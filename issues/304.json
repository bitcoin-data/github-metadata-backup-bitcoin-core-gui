Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI created lot of wallets to test something else related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21510\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/116490651-8e026280-a8b5-11eb-9e0b-55af493fa2ca.png)\r\n\r\nWanted to check how GUI works after having so many wallets and first thing I noticed is the time it takes to display wallets for \"Open Wallet\" option, number of wallets and the whole screen covered with these names. It doesn't even include all the names and maybe they have gone out of the screen on right side.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/116490599-66ab9580-a8b5-11eb-81f7-c9b95e70a1ca.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOnly display name for default wallet and maybe 9 other wallets based on some criteria. Provide an option to mention name/path for other wallets to open.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMove the wallets to a different location.\r\n",
