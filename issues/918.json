    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nThe GUI crashes in regtest immediately on start. It did work once initially but has been crashing since, tried quite a few times.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe GUI should not crash in regtest, just like it doesn't in main or test environments.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFollowing is the command I have used. Also, tried a few variants of the `-datadir, -walletdir` args by adding and removing `/regtest`.\n\n```\n➜  bitcoin git:(master) ✗ ./build/bin/bitcoin-qt -datadir=/Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/regtest -conf=/Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/bitcoin-reg.conf -walletdir=/Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/regtest/wallets\n```\n\nError received in the UI and the terminal.\n```\nError: SQLiteDatabase: Failed to configure serialized threading mode: bad parameter or other API misuse\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```zsh\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z Bitcoin Core version v30.99.0-13891a8a685d (release build)\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z parameter interaction: -bind set -> setting -listen=1\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z Qt 6.9.0 (dynamic), plugin=cocoa\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z No static plugins.\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z Style: macos / QMacStyle\n2025-12-17T10:22:15Z System: macOS Sequoia (15.4), x86_64-little_endian-lp64\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z GUI: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z GUI: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z GUI: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z GUI: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z GUI: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using RdSeed as an additional entropy source\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Default data directory /Users/rkrux/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using data directory /Users/rkrux/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/regtest\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file: /Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/bitcoin-reg.conf\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: regtest=\"1\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] bind=\"127.0.0.1:28334\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] bind=\"127.0.0.1:28335=onion\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] port=\"28333\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] rpcpassword=****\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] rpcport=\"28332\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Config file arg: [regtest] rpcuser=****\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Setting file arg: wallet = [\"test\"]\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Command-line arg: conf=\"/Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/bitcoin-reg.conf\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Command-line arg: walletdir=\"/Users/rkrux/Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/regtest/wallets\"\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using at most 125 automatic connections (1024 file descriptors available)\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z scheduler thread start\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using wallet directory /Users/rkrux/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/regtest/wallets\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z Using SQLite Version 3.43.2\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z init message: Verifying wallet(s)…\n2025-12-17T10:22:16Z [warning] SQLite Error.

      "body": "> Is this really gui-specific? Does it not happen with bitcoind?\n\nYes, it seems to be GUI specific, and doesn't happen with bitcoind alone.\n\n> Can you check the directory permissions please\n\nI did and noticed that the regtest and testnet subdirectories didn't have the r|x permissions for group and others, unlike the data directory. I gave those permissions to them but I don't believe it was the issue - when I was looking into the directory permissions, I also noticed that one regtest subdirectory was present within the regtest subdirectory. I rm-rf'ed it and ran the GUI again, it worked then.\n\nHowever, the GUI seems to be creating this additional subdirectory every time it is run, and I have to delete it every time, otherwise the same error pops up. If I run the GUI without the `-walletdir` argument so that the additional subdirectory is not created, the GUI runs but it is not able to find the already present wallets that I have in regtest, so this argument seems necessary to me, but at the cost of deleting the additional subdirectory after the next run.\n",
