    "title": "PSBT Operations View: Edit PSBT?",
    "body": "I was creating a large transaction (to load up some opendimes). I stopped to do something else, so I saved the PSBT. I came back and wanted to continue adding outputs, I tried to load the PSBT again but there was no way to continue editing it. It just popped up the PSBT Operations view showing that it was unsigned. I had to start all over again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could be an \"edit\" button on the operations view which populates the Send tab with the PSBT inputs and outputs so you can continue editing the transaction? Editing signed PSBTs might get complex, such as having to invalidate signatures if inputs/outputs change, so perhaps this would only make sense for unsigned PSBTs. In the future perhaps we could do something more intelligent depending on what is signed and unsigned, sighash flags, etc. For now I think an edit operation for unsigned PSBTs might be handy?",
