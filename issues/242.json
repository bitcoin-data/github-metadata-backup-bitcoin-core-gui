First, it makes it more expensive for the original sender to RBF their transaction (since they need to pay to replace both the original and all descended transactions).  Second, it means that if you actually pay someone, not just CPFP back to your self, your payment will be deleted; this could end up with you thinking you paid someone and them thinking you didn't, causing problems.\r\n\r\nPossible workarounds right now for you:\r\n\r\n1. Use CLI: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/242#issuecomment-797884849\r\n2. Use a different wallet: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/102904/recovering-and-transferring-bitcoin-to-new-wallet",

      "body": "Sorry, I just saw this.  The conversation of mine referred to in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/242#issuecomment-802666743 seems to have been misunderstood.  My first response to seeing this issue was, \"GUI CPFP is a good idea\".  The rest of my response, including what's quoted above, was about allowing spending unconfirmed incoming payments to other people.  I think it would definitely be good to allow:\r\n\r\n- Alice pays Bob with a low fee\r\n- Bob right clicks the unconfirmed transaction it the GUI, clicks \"bump fee\"\r\n- Bob is prompted for how much fee he wants to pay\r\n- Wallet generates a spend of the UTXO to a new address belonging to Bob\r\n\r\nWhat we don't want to do is:\r\n\r\n- Alice pays Bob with a low fee\r\n- Bob goes to the regular Send screen, types in Carols address, and sends her the unconfirmed coins from Alice\r\n\r\nSorry for any confusion.  Here's the full conversation:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[6:18:43 pm] <prayank> Can we change `spendzeroconfchange` to `spendzeroconfcoins` ?\r\n\r\n[8:37:09 pm] <harding> prayank: are you suggesting just changing the\r\noption name, or changing its behavior so that it'll spend coins received\r\nfrom third parties as well as your own change?\r\n\r\n[8:44:10 pm] <prayank> harding: name and behavior\r\n[8:44:22 pm] <prayank> Context: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/242\r\n\r\n[8:46:55 pm] <harding> Hmm.  GUI CPFP is a good idea, but I think that's\r\na different issue than allowing spends of other people's unconfirmed\r\ntransactions, especially if we're also encouraging ecosystem adoption of\r\nRBF.\r\n\r\n[9:02:38 pm] <prayank> RBF can always be used if I am sending BTC but\r\nCPFP is the only option left if I received it with a low fee from\r\nsomeone. It's already possible using CLI and other wallets so why not\r\nGUI?\r\n\r\n[9:05:32 pm] <harding> prayank: I mean, if we're encouraging other\r\npeople to use RBF then allowing you to spend your unconfirmed coins to\r\nother people creates several problems.  First, it makes it more\r\nexpensive for the original sender to RBF their transaction (since they\r\nneed to pay to replace both the original and all descended\r\ntransactions).  Second, it means that if you actually pay someone, not\r\njust CPFP back to your self, your payment will be deleted; this could\r\nend up with you thinking you paid someone and them thinking you didn't,\r\ncausing problems.\r\n\r\n[9:15:19 pm] <prayank> Payment will be deleted? This is something new. I\r\ndon't think I understood. So you are saying if I received 0.1 BTC from\r\nBinance with fee rate 10 sat/vByte, didn't confirm for hours, I spent\r\nthe unconfirmed UTXO to send BTC to Bitfinex with fee rate 200\r\nsat/vByte. Will there be an issue?\r\n\r\n[9:19:50 pm] <harding> If Binance RBFs the 0.1 transaction, say\r\nincreasing it to 20 sat/vbyte, that changes its txid.  Your transaction\r\nto Bitfinex now references the wrong previous txid, so it is deleted\r\nfrom the mempool.  You'll need to create a new spend to Bitfinex.\r\n\r\n[9:23:56 pm] <prayank> Yeah RBF + CPFP can have issues\r\n[9:31:10 pm] <prayank> Maybe offtopic for this channel but sharing a\r\nlink I read last year. Thread is about receiver paying fees for a\r\ntransaction instead of sender. Interesting thought and CPFP usage in\r\ndifferent wallets can make it easier:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/LaurentMT/status/1292100695584378883\r\n\r\n[9:38:03 pm] <harding> I think you probably want something like payjoin\r\nrather than CPFP for receiver-pays-fee, at least when interaction is\r\npossible.\r\n[9:38:55 pm] <harding> Ultimately, a merchant is going to pass on the\r\ncost of fees to the buyer, so I'm not sure receiver-pays makes sense in\r\nmost cases.\r\n\r\n[9:44:34 pm] <prayank> Yes also it can be exploited in few cases\r\nmentioned by Sergej Kotliar:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ziggamon/status/1292115411761344512\r\n[9:47:05 pm] <prayank> In few cases it can make sense. For example: A\r\nDEX protocol which involves on-chain bitcoin transaction and two peers.\r\nThe one who is taker in this trade should pay the fees and maker should\r\njust broadcast with 1 sat/vByte. Or maybe so many other cases that I\r\ncan't think of right now\r\n```",
