    "title": "[Design] Onboarding Wizard 1.0",
    "body": "Overview of current on boarding process (old top, new bottom).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91942818-21d35d00-ed2e-11ea-85bb-bbabc17b3bb8.png)\r\n**1.0 Problems**\r\n\r\nIn general, the on-boarding is very limited / almost non-existent. Having an on-boarding process is one of the best ways to educate users about features (wallet / node) and other more general info (privacy / security practices). Currently the user is thrown into the deep end with the GUI without a clear explanation as to what is going on or what steps to take next.  \r\n\r\nNo option to select the users language exists in the current on-boarding. Having this as the first option will significantly improve the UX for non-English users (the current default language). Currently, the only way to set language is within the GUI itself which means non-English users will likely miss the current node info welcome screen. \r\n\r\nDetails such as what is the Bitcoin core GUI, what is a node, why should you run a node, and what is a pruned node are not clearly articulated / given the importance they deserve in the current welcome screen. This is mostly due to a cluttered UI and unclear explanations. https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/26 \r\n\r\n**2.0 Solutions**\r\n\r\nThis on-boarding process is only gone through when the user launches the GUI for the first time after installation. Each design has had a cleaning up of its UI. Design specifics (padding, margins, fonts etc.) can be found in my figma design [source files](https://www.figma.com/file/FJ02rY3m8V9ZCDvoXjW39W/Bitcoin-Core?node-id=462%3A655) - feel free to leave comments on figma directly by clicking the speech bubble in the top left and clicking the part of the design you wish to comment on. \r\n\r\n**2.1 New Welcome Screen**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91941432-cc964c00-ed2b-11ea-8af9-6d5a685e7381.png)\r\n\r\nThis new welcome screen gives a simple explanation to the user what the GUI is. Although this might seem trivial I've seen some users who have downloaded the GUI still unclear on this point. The download page on bitcoincore.org/en/download does not explain the features of the GUI so I understand the confusion some may have. \r\n\r\n**2.2 Your Full Node Screen**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/91942549-b5585e00-ed2d-11ea-8fff-f4e9fbab1343.png)\r\n\r\n**3.0 Extra**\r\n\r\n**Why am I doing this in versions?**\r\nBreaking up designs into more manageable steps, much like using atomic commits, make things easier from an implementation perspective. V1 is primarily a content re-work and does not involve any major technical changes.\r\n\r\nV2 (WIP) will have basic wallet creation embedded. Currently the GUI automatically creates a default wallet on launching without prompting the user it was created or giving them any details about wallets which can lead to a lot of confusion https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15454. The create wallet flow for the on-boarding will be similar to what I have done here https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77\r\n\r\nV3 I'd like to explore having HWI and other more complex ways to load and create wallets.\r\n\r\n**Design constraints**\r\nThe Bitcoin Core GUI uses Qt Widgets which inherits most of its design components from the host OS, this design was done for WindowsOS but should translate nicely to MacOS and Linux. If people would prefer me to do these designs in Linux or MacOS instead please let me know. \r\n\r\n[Figma source file](https://www.figma.com/file/4dO1LqPY0WAgp5d1Bz3U8j/Bitcoin-Core-Designs?node-id=0%3A1)",

What could I do better? What is unclear? Do you want more visual representations, more words or all of the above? For example I could include gifs to show how the flow works more clearly (I will update OP with one for this flow soon) - is this useful? \r\n\r\nFeedback on features I may have missed / you think should be apart of this flow is also very helpful (see my discussion with achow at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77).

      "body": "Some updated designs based on feedback [WIP]:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/93970615-072a5c00-fda1-11ea-8b10-3a52ef724fc8.png)\r\n\r\n### Global changes\r\n\r\nDid some branding updates based on discussions on issue https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/89. Changed link colors, launch screen logo, top menu icon and logo displayed on welcome window. \r\n\r\nCleaned up the UI slightly, re-worded most of the content only detailing what is relevant to end users with links to deeper dives for those interested.\r\n\r\n### Your bitcoin full node window\r\n\r\n**Standard mode**\r\nThis is just the standard mode currently used in the GUI. \r\n\r\n**Quickstart mode**\r\n@jonasschnelli mentioned [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/45#issuecomment-682375524) about having a block-filters/SPV mode enabled whilst the IBD happens in the background - is this technically feasibly? This would be a major UX improvement but doesn't come without downfalls which I've communicated in the modes description. If the user selects this option maybe connecting via Tor should be on by default to prevent IP leaks until the IBD is complete (which the user would then switch to normal peers through their own node). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Node settings window\r\n\r\nListed 4 config options most relevant to end users / should be considered prior to beginning IBD. Bear in mind this is targeted at more beginner users, advanced users will likely edit .config file themselves (which I have included a link to more advanced config options at the top). \r\n\r\n**Bitcoin blockchain directory** \r\nIncluded in previous design, many end users may not have the 500GB free on their main drive (likely an SSD these days) and may want to move it onto another drive. Also included a small tool tip to the right of the change button indicating the available storage in selected drive. User should be prompted if not enough storage is available in the default directory and be unable to click 'launch,' _see below:_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/93970639-17423b80-fda1-11ea-9777-7dc94ff7ce0f.png)\r\n\r\nWhen enabling pruned node the full IBD still occurs before old blocks are discarded correct? I initially thought instead of not letting the user go forward if they do not have enough storage it could auto-select prune node but this would not work based on my understanding. \r\n\r\n**Limit node storage** \r\nRenamed 'Prune node' to 'Limit node storage'. To an end user limit node storage communicates more clearly what it is they are doing when taking this action. Pruning sounds ambiguous to those not familiar with the term in the context of a blockchain. I also clarified that when you limit storage (prune) you are limiting to a set amount of history (a year in my design, see below). \r\n\r\nThere is also a UX issue with importing old wallets with a pruned node - is there an ideal pruned size that caters to majority of users? I put a years worth of transaction history (~50GB) as a placeholder for now based on this thread - [reference](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5213552.0). This is something I'll do some more research on. \r\n\r\nIt may be worth changing how pruned nodes are communicated in the internal settings as well - e.g. instead of 'prune block storage to xGB' it could say something like 'Only store blocks in from the past x days (or years).' I'd assume users are more likely to know that they had transactions from a year ago than ~50GB of blocks ago. I've heard some issues raised that prune nodes only store tx's relevant to the user (disregarding history) which is not the case - this should communicate how it works more clearly. Though this is an issue for another time. \r\n\r\n**Launch on startup** \r\nA common UX headache myself and many others seem to have is that if they do not have core running all the time so when they go to send or check a received tx they have to wait to sync with most recent blocks first. This can be especially painful if you use bitcoin as a SoV and rarely transact. Having this selected by default will likely alleviate this issue without too much issues for the user - I'd imagine hardware constraints aren't a huge issue for people running core on a desktop or laptop. You could even take this a step further and have it now shown and on by default. \r\n\r\n**Connect via Tor** \r\nAs mentioned above, should this be enabled by default if the user clicks quickstart mode? Having to download Tor separately is likely going to be an issue for many users (they will just skip over it and get a false sense of privacy if clicking connect). Still unsure if this should be an option presented to end users for these reasons but privacy should be paramount. \r\n\r\nI'd imagine this may be out of the question but could the GUI be shipped with a tor executable similar to wasabi's setup? Maybe even take things a step further and have separate binaries fom the CLI and GUI (GUI ships with Tor for default, no config privacy)? An example of a project that separates the two is Monero - https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/ \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of UX decisions to digest here, looking forward to everyone's feedback! \r\n\r\n[Figma source file](https://www.figma.com/file/FJ02rY3m8V9ZCDvoXjW39W/Bitcoin-Core?node-id=1684%3A38)",

      "body": "As I've told you previously, love the design!\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n\r\nThe `About Bitcoin` on 'Page 1'? (not the correct terminology) links to Bitcoin Wiki; the `Learn More`/`click here` buttons on 'Page 2' and 'Page 3' link to Bitcoin.org.  Is there a page on the Bitcoin Wiki we could link to instead?\r\n\r\nOn Page 3, Under `Limit node storage`: \"...Importing wallets older than a year may not show correct transaction information, increasing node storage may fix this.\"  Perhaps: \"...increasing node storage or reindexing the chain should fix this.\r\n\r\nThere is no info about the option to prune a node until Page 3 (and on Page 2, it currently says \"A full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain (~350GB) will be downloaded).
