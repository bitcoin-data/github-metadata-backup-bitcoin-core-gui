    "body": "Currently the gui is designed (or kept as-is) based on guessing how it is used. I'd say that developers and reviewers mostly use their own experience as a proxy how everyone else is using the gui.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the gui had a way to record usage statistics, which can be enabled by users that want to opt-in to sharing this. The users could then upload the file to share their report with developers.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what ways qt offers to achieve this, but even a plain simple click counter for each button would be better than nothing.",

      "body": "Instead of capturing \"all\" events, this could also be driven by hypothesis we want to clarify. For example:\r\n- How important is it to be able to include multiple recipients in a transaction? If almost no-one uses this (and we find that some other aspect of transactions has more interest), the UI could be adjusted to match user priorities.\r\n- Is address reuse common? If so, the UI could be adjusted to discourage this.\r\n- How many users adjust fees? Are those adjusted values reasonable? If not, more education could be added. \r\n- After starting the application, how long does it usually take until all blocks are synced? If this is super long and uses 200% CPU on average, maybe some sort of optimization is needed\r\n- What types of wallets are created most? Which types get the most usage?\r\n\r\nI just totally made these up and they might be unrealistic, so ignore the details. My point is that by starting with hypotheses, it's easier to ensure that only relevant data is gathered, the resulting data set is more likely to be useful, and it's much easier for users to understand why this is done and be comfortable sharing.\r\n\r\nI'd be more comfortable sharing a data set that includes (totally made up to make my point) lines like \"You reuse addresses 3 times on average\" and \"You typically increase the default fee by 10%\" than endless lists of logs.\r\n\r\nThe privacy aspect is super critical to this. Ideally users can upload the data completely anonymous.\r\n",

Generally nothing that can be used to correlate balances, identity, or location.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, the kinds of sensitive information would be:\r\n- addresses\r\n- timestamps\r\n- amounts\r\n- transaction hashes\r\n- ip addresses\r\n- labels\r\n- language\r\n- …?\r\n\r\nJust by themselves usage patterns can be useful, but we will also need to know the environment and configuration of the operator, as it can influence these patterns (features that are removed or renamed). So some additional data points would also have to be collected so the usage data can be segmented. This can also help facilitate debugging, [example](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11703).\r\n\r\n1. Software Version\r\n2. Operating System\r\n3. Machine Specs\r\n4. UI Configs (exclude language)\r\n5. …?\r\n\r\nLog files are not the most easy to read, so making this data easily consumable by the operator via a UI would allow them to assess if they are comfortable sharing this data, and could possibly be a useful for them depending on what is being collected. Perhaps we learn more about possible monitoring requirements, and roll those in pending the results of the survey.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What would the storage requirements be for such kind of logging?",

We could decide on hypotheses that focus on collecting data on new features added with that version, for example how users use descriptors in 0.21.0 release. These could be mixed in with some more general meta hypotheses such as what kind of wallets users use / how users construct tx's etc. The results of achow's survery will be helpful in deciding what hypothesis we test. All testing should be opt in and be anonymous as possible. \r\n\r\nThe opt in should be presented via on-boarding when using the GUI for the first time or via an overlay on first launch when updating to a newer GUI version. The info in the GUI should give a rough overview of what is being collected with a link to more in-depth documentation detailing what / why / when data is being collected (hosted on GitHub / bitcoincore.org?). \r\n\r\nWould also be handy to have an opt in option in the settings if the user changes their mind and wants to contribute data later on.
