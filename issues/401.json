    "title": "Summary of Direction/Type columns problem and a new suggested trade-off",
    "body": "As mentioned in #372, the \"Type\" column without the \"Direction\" one looks indeed like unfinished business.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm using the \"Type\" column sorting every time I open the GUI. And I'll be very disappointed if we end up with reverting this feature back (see #372).\r\n\r\nOne of the flaws in the current state is mixing of independent data in the \"Address\" column content. It leads to unwanted issues (see #397, #400).\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have two alternative PRs that add the \"Direction\" column: #317 and #363.\r\n\r\n### #317 (#289)\r\n\r\n- has support of 5 developers (including pr authors)\r\n- 2 developers expressed their satisfaction with the current state (one of these opinions includes a [suggestion for a different approach](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/317#issuecomment-869010406))\r\n- 1 developer submitted an alternative PR\r\n\r\n### #363\r\n\r\n- has support of 1 developer (pr author only)\r\n- 2 developers expressed their disagreement\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I still believe we could find the common ground and reach the rough consensus in this problem.\r\n\r\nHere is my attempt at formulating the distinguished issues related to the problem.\r\n\r\n### Issue 1: Mixing of independent data\r\n\r\nThe fact is that a connection direction and a peer address are completely independent data, therefore, a table that presents such data to users shouldn't mix them into one column, as this definitely hurts UX.\r\n\r\nFor historical notes, see:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13483\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13537\r\n\r\n### Issue 2: Semantics of \"arrows\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that arrow symbols—neither \"up\" and \"down\" (current state), nor \"left\" and \"right\"—have _no_ implicit or ubiquitous semantics of \"inbound\" and \"outbound\". They mean nothing without a context.\r\n\r\n### Issue 3: Horizontal space and Localization\r\n\r\nOne of the concerns about adding a new \"Direction\" column is that it consumes more horizontal space then a symbol does.\r\nAs an alternative, the \"in\" and \"out\" short words were suggested (disregarding letter capitalization).\r\n\r\nThe main flaw of such an approach is that the shortest _translated_ words with the suitable meanings could be much longer. It makes this approach practically useless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note about symbols\r\n\r\nWe could replace arrows with symbols with suitable semantics, for example:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/blob/master/src/qt/res/icons/tx_input.png\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-08-08 15-01-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32963518/128631275-d9206faa-9498-40cd-aeac-d6e75dc9349b.png)\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/blob/master/src/qt/res/icons/tx_output.png\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-08-08 15-02-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32963518/128631318-8c28dc13-3bef-4cfb-90d6-67fa0ca7b543.png)\r\n\r\nOr we could choose any other free icons _with_ appropriate semantics.\r\n\r\n### Note about data mixing\r\n\r\nAfter replacing the meaningless \"arrow\" symbols with some meaningful ones, it'll still require to move it out from the \"Address\" column:\r\n- (A) into a new dedicated \"Direction\" column\r\n- (B) into the current \"Type\" column\r\n\r\n### Note about horizontal space and Localization\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the (A) solution won't save the horizontal space in all cases. The \"Direction\" column still require a header title, e.g., the word \"Direction\". And, again, its localized variant could be much longer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Suggested trade-off approach: a combined \"Direction/Type\" column instead of the current \"Type\" one\r\n\r\nThe combining a direction and a type data into one column looks pretty legitimate because these data are closely entangled (see #203).\r\n\r\nHere are possible implementations:\r\n- (B.1) an icon-prefixed string\r\n- (B.2) considering that in the current \"Type\" column cells are empty _iif_ a connection is inbound, we could use the \"Inbound\" word as a type of inbound connection, and connections with other types are implicitly outbound. In that case no icons/symbols are required at all.\r\n\r\nI think the B.2 solution is a good trade-off. And it does not increase the horizontal space usage. Actually, this solution decreases it by removing arrow symbols from the \"Address\" column.\r\n\r\nSearching for productive discussion without opinions based on personal taste.",
