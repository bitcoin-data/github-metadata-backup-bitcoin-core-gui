      "body": "The `avoid_reuse` flag can be set at wallet creation, but that dialog is already rather complicated. The flag can also be toggled for existing wallets. We don't have a UI to change settings for the currently selected wallet, but we probably should.\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be to just have that as a checkbox in the send dialog. As an aside: it would be nice if the send dialog checked if it was about to reuse, and then showed a little warning text, something like: \"This transaction reuses an address which may hurt your privacy. You can avoid this by clicking here, but it reduces your available balance.\" This seems a better UX than hiding part of the balance, which is scary.\r\n\r\nAdding GUI support for `avoid_reuse`  is probably sufficient, because enabling that implies `-avoidpartialspends`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -avoidpartialspends\r\n       Group outputs by address, selecting all or none, instead of selecting on\r\n       a per-output basis. Privacy is improved as an address is only\r\n       used once (unless someone sends to it after spending from it),\r\n       but may result in slightly higher fees as suboptimal coin\r\n       selection may result due to the added limitation (default: 0\r\n       (always enabled for wallets with \"avoid_reuse\" enabled))\r\n```",
