Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen I use the menu for `File -> Open Wallet`, I get a popup saying \"Opening wallet xxx....\" with a progress bar. There is no other information. The progress bar just loops endlessly. I can of course close this popup by clicking the X normally. If I try to use the menu item again, I get the same popup and the same looping progress bar.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1900684/201532617-65bb175a-51df-4a9f-991b-d55740384c09.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this was a bug, and was in the process of submitting a bug report, until I checked `debug.log`. I shouldn't have to check a log file to understand whats happening. Inside I found these lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-13T16:24:26Z [specter3c64f804925fff38\\mymultisig] Still rescanning.

Progress=0.980183\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWaiting until this process completed allowed the wallet to open.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI think the text on that popup window should be changed to be more descriptive for the user. The current text of \"Opening wallet.....\" with nothing but a looping progress bar, initially led me to believe that the wallet file was corrupted or something. That maybe Core couldn't open it, and was just hung or looped. \r\n\r\nThe text should be changed to something like \"Syncing wallet with chain...\" or however you want to word it, additionally with a progress bar that show's the actual percentage like is shown inside the log file.",
