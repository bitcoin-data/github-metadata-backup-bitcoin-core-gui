When I tried to restart the node it wont start anymore, it gives me \"Error 127.0.0.1:9150 incorrect Proxy\" and it shuts down immediately. What can I do to get the node to start again?  the GUI is not even starting. I just stared exploring with bitcoin nodes and Im not knowledgable at all, any help will be greatly appreciated. Im running the node on Debian Linux.",

      "body": "Hi @nbit846,\r\n \r\nThis issue tracker is supposed to be used to track technical issues related to the Bitcoin Core GUI code base.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) or the #bitcoin IRC channel on the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) network.\r\n\r\nIn your case I'd advise checking the bitcoin data directory (`~/.bitcoin`) while the node is not running. You should find a file named `settings.json` which may be persisting the erroneous setting. This can be removed and the node then restarted.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't experience the same issue as you when specifying a bad port in that dialogue box, so I'm not totally convinced this is the root cause of your issue (nor that the above step will solve it). Are the any other errors printed in `~/.bitcoin/debug.log`?",
