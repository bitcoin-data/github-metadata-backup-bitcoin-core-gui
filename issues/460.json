Please describe.**\r\n\r\n`-startupnotify` and `-shutdownnotify` configuration parameter accept shell commands to be executed after Bitcoin Core starts/shutdown\r\n\r\nOne is still WIP and not merged: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23395\r\n\r\nThis provides options for attackers to target new users of Bitcoin Core and one example which involves some social engineering is explained in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23395#issuecomment-956353035\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI am not sure how is this used currently by different users and projects however if reading notifications about start/shutdown is the goal maybe a file with name `notifications.dat` with below format can help:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlastshutdown=1635786273\r\nlastrestart=SOMEUNIXTIME\r\ncurrentstate=shutdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially suggested this solution in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23395#issuecomment-955775728\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nEducate users about misuse of *notify options\r\n",
