    "body": "Currently, PeerTableModel::data() is called approximately 2128 times per second, and within that 288 times to update the display. Assuming 10 rows and 9 columns, this still averages at about 3 updates per field per second, which given that most fields so not change (network, direction, IP address) seems potentially excessive, and seems to cause significant traffic to X servers.\r\n\r\nStill testing workarounds to this.",

The CPU thrashing will (immediately) drop when the `network traffic` window is closed.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nViewing the `network traffic` page should not use 100% CPU or cause thrashing.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n## steps\r\n\r\n* Run `bitcoin-qt`, open `network traffic` and wait some time? I think the graph needs to include a wide range of datapoints for this (rendering?) bug to occur (see below screenshots).\r\n\r\n## actions\r\n\r\nI ran `perf` for 30 seconds on `bitcoin-qt` while CPU was thrashing, but it seemed to only [show a lot of time spent in `libQT5Gui.so`](https://tmp.256k1.dev/23_10_bitcoin_qt_cpu.svg),  which doesn't seem particularly helpful.  \r\n\r\nI noticed that the CPU spikes seem to only be present when the graph is well-populated with many variously-valued data points, like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/6606587/97b752af-89dc-42e9-83ff-08302ec08c51)\r\n\r\nHowever CPU usage drops if there is a large spike in network activity, which causes a low level of datapoint variation (plus one large spike), like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/6606587/20b0a757-2f8c-4887-a89f-b2f390ebcce2)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nNothing of interest was present in the logs.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.99.0-04265ba9378e\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 23.04\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nOS: Ubuntu 23.04 x86_64\r\nCPU: 11th Gen Intel i7-11700K (16) @ 3.800GHz\r\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\r\nMemory: 64162MiB\r\nHDD: Samsung SSD 990 PRO 2TB\r\nMB: Z590 AORUS ELITE AX\r\nKernel: 6.2.0-33-generic\r\nResolution: 3840x2160\r\nWM: i3\r\nTerminal: tmux\r\nShell: fish 3.6.1",
