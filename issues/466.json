    "body": "Currently, PeerTableModel::data() is called approximately 2128 times per second, and within that 288 times to update the display. Assuming 10 rows and 9 columns, this still averages at about 3 updates per field per second, which given that most fields so not change (network, direction, IP address) seems potentially excessive, and seems to cause significant traffic to X servers.\r\n\r\nStill testing workarounds to this.",
