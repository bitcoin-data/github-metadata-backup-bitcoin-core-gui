    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nYes. When sending transactions from bitcoin core, there is a checkbox to indicate whether the user would like to take the transaction fee from the amount they've entered. This decision isn't, however, remembered- and so funds can be assumed to be taken out of the rest of one's balance. This problem is very aggravating, as it undermines the privacy of using multiple receiving wallets to prevent traceability and mixing of one's fund history within the blockchain. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like by default for the transaction page to remember which settings you've chosen (especially the fee from amount checkbox), and for this default to be mutable in bitcoin core's options.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere aren't many alternatives other than tediously enabling this option every transaction after you didn't realize at first. I might not be aware of some cli method to achieve this, but if there were such a thing it would still be very user-unfriendly.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64972947/126909997-20a7556a-7850-4519-8aa5-46ec8ee288a8.png)\r\n\r\n",
