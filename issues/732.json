Without knowing this I'd feel really uncomfortable signing the PSBT.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe change output should be marked as belonging to me.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen a PSBT file that has one output for the payee (not yours) and one output to you (as change)\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n25.0rc2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nDebian 11\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
