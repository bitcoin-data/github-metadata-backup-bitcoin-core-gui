    "body": "Moved from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17969/\r\n\r\n## What Happens\r\nWhen you click File|Sign Message, the UI asks you to choose an address with which to sign.  You can enter one by hand, paste from clipboard, or \"Choose a previously used address.\"  The third option provides a list of addresses that includes addresses for which there is no private key (P2SH addresses).  This is intimately related to #10542 but the fix _here_ is straightforward.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nI expect addresses for which no private key is known to be excluded from the list presented.  I realize that the same list is used to select an address to which to receive a payment, but that code could be adjusted to accept a filter, or the private-key-less addresses could be filtered out during display.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n## To reproduce\r\nEnsure that you have at least one P2SH address in your Bitcoin core wallet.\r\nSelect File | Sign Message\r\nClick the address book.\r\nNote that there are P2SH addresses offered for selection.\r\n\r\nThis is in Bitcoin Core 0.18.",
