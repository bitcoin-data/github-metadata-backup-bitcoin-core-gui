    "title": "Wallet/transaction notifications: Only a single notification is displayed",
    "body": "There are actually multiple issues here, at least:\n1. `WalletView::processNewTransaction` only looks at the first of a batch of inserted rows.\n2. `QSystemTrayIcon`'s X11 implementation (`QBalloonTip`, internal-only) only allows a single notification, destroying the previous when a new one is shown\n3. Showing possibly hundreds of notifications would be terrible UX\n\nIt seems like the GUI should queue notifications at the same \"instant\" (eg, a new block), and if there's multiple send a summary of them all (number of transactions, total sent, total received/mined). This may require some refactoring work, as notifications currently follow the TransactionTableModel insertion slots.",
