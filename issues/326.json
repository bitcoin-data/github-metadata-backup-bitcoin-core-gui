    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI'm on a dual-core (4 hyperthread) machine. I have many tabs open. When I open Bitcoin to sync, my browser randomly freezes for a couple seconds every minute or two, impeding my work, usually at the least convenient time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like Bitcoin GUI to add a checkbox to lower the kernel-level priority of the Bitcoin process during Initial Block Download. (IBD)\r\n\r\nBy making it more convenient for ordinary users who have their resources already near-saturated, we can improve decentralization. #KeepBitcoinDecentralized\r\n\r\nWhen I used `renice` to lower the priority of Bitcoin to +20 on macOS 10.14.6, I experienced almost no freezes while waiting for Bitcoin to sync.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- **Only syncing Bitcoin when I'm idle on the computer:** Too inconvenient to set up\r\n- **Only syncing Bitcoin at night:** Not convenient for most laptop users whose laptops automatically sleep, and impossible for people who prefer to fully shutdown their computers at night to avoid distractions\r\n\r\nHappy to write the code for this myself if someone can explain where to start.",

Lowering this will use less threads.\r\n- dbcache value\r\n  - Bitcoin Core performs a lot of I/O. Increasing the cache value should slightly lower the amount of times Core has to write to disk.",
