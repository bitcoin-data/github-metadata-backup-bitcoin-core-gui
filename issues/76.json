Please describe.**\r\n- bitcoin.conf file is used by lot of users with different settings\r\n- any malware can modify this file which can affect bitcoin core wallet\r\n- if the user is unaware of changes made by someone else in bitcoin.conf, it may affect UX, privacy and maybe security\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- user should be notified if the file was changed when wallet is loading\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- maybe user can keep his system secure and bitcoin core related files however the solution I suggested is basic information about file modification time and changes nothing much related to how wallet works\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMaybe we can add text below \"The Bitcoin Core Developers\" to display such information\r\n\r\n![Example-Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/qLpBKmw.png)\r\n",
