Draft / compose: enter recipient, amount, fees, etc. (the current Send screen).\r\n\r\nThis step is skipped when loading a PSBT (e.g. via menu: Transaction -> Load, or a smart clipboard).\r\n\r\n2. Sign: currently a popup which confirms the details. With hardware wallets (e.g. #16549) this should enumerate connected wallets and let you sign one by one. In a multisig situation it should detect if any signatures are missing, and rename the 3rd step to \"Export\".\r\n\r\n3. Finish / Export: once again repeat the importantant details. For basic wallets with private keys in it, this should just show that the transaction has been broadcast. With a completed PSBT it should let the user choose between broadcasting or exporting (clipboard, save to disk).",

      "body": "@Rspigler The offline computer, inherently due to being offline, does not have a copy of the blockchain. That means it can't create transactions, because of Bitcoin's UTXO model. Every transaction must spend some coins, but you need the blockchain in order to know what coins you have.\r\n\r\nI copied this basic workflow from Armory, and from BIP 174 PSBT, but in principle there are other workflows possible, and you could push more work onto the offline machine -- you could have the online machine merely provide a list of coins in the wallet, and let the offline machine perform all coin selection and transaction creation. I don't have a sense of what the benefits / drawbacks of such a setup might be. (In the Bitcoin setting, where all transaction contents are public, there can be no privacy benefit that I can see; everything will eventually have to pass through the online machine anyway. Any security benefit from having the offline machine _build_ the transaction SHOULD also be available from using the offline machine to _review_ the transaction before signing it, which is the current workflow that I think everybody uses.)\r\n\r\n(One could imagine a privacy-coin setting, unlike Bitcoin, where the online machine need not even know which coins were spent. But I don't know enough to speculate about what information the offline machine would need for transaction creation in that case, and it's not directly relevant to Bitcoin Core at any rate.)",
