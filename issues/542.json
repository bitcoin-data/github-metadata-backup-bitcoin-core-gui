    "title": "Error \"Cannot set -listen=0 together with -listenonion=1\" if incoming connections are disabled",
    "body": "Bitcoin-Qt doesn't start properly if incoming connections are disabled. It seems that this is caused by a conflicting Tor-related default setting. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin-Qt should start normally.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin-Qt complains: \"Cannot set -listen=0 together with -listenonion=1\" and refuses to start.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nWhat I did:\r\n- Compiled bitcoin-qt from source on Linux\r\n- Started bitcoin-qt\r\n- Opened settings and disabled incoming connections\r\n- Restarted bitcoin-qt\r\n- Restarted bitcoin-qt again (had to reboot the computer)\r\n- bug occurred\r\n- Restarted bitcoin-qt with -listen=1 or -listenonion=0\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nCompiled from source, latest Git revision as of 2nd of Feb.\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n\r\nüëçüëç for the error message, it was clear and explained the problem as well as how to work around it.\r\n\r\nWhen starting Bitcoin-Qt for the first time after disabling incoming connections, it started properly. This was strange, but is it because of the \"restart required\" flag in the configuration?\r\n\r\nIt seems that DEFAULT_LISTEN_ONION is \"true\" and there's no GUI switch to change this, and I didn't find an option in the configuration file either but -listenonion=0 works. I think the problem occurs in init.cpp, line 890.\r\n\r\n",
