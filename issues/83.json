For example, trying to send 2000 sats with a low transaction fee (of 2123 sat/kB) on a watch-only balance of more than 50 000 sats.\r\n- I do see the \"create unsigned\" button in the bottom-left corner.\r\n![amount-exceeds-your-balance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66416066/92305697-86bdcb80-ef57-11ea-9442-308de88478f1.png)\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nXubuntu 18.04.5\r\nBitcoin Core 0.20.1\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue?

I thought maybe that was the cause (not a full rescan) so I later tried that as well.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to :\r\n1. use an airgapped coldcard hardware wallet (without usb, with only a microSD) to produce addresses completely offline,\r\n2. be able to watch them with bitcoin core, and\r\n3. later be able to use bitcoin core (online) to do a psbt transaction for signature on the airgapped coldcard,\r\n4. all without exporting-importing the xpub.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't see any way to get the witness script directly from the coldcard. I see by your answer that I misunderstood what is necessary to construct the psbt. Thank you very much for your time answering my issue!\r\n",
