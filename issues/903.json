    "body": "### Issues, reports or feature requests related to the GUI should be opened directly on the GUI repo\n\n- [x] I still think this issue should be opened here\n\n### Report\n\nSo I've just tried the `v30.0` release and I have it up and running on Arch Linux, bitcoin-qt is running natively on Wayland (sway).\n\nAfter using the GUI for a while, I have noticed that the whole window would flicker, e.g. when switching between \"Overview\" and \"Transactions\".\n\nThis never happened before, and I think the reason for that is because the app would use Xwayland prior to Qt 6.\n\nSo yes, one way of avoiding this problem is to start bitcoin-qt with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`, however, I would very much like this to work with the Wayland native plugin, which is used by default.\n\nI did some small experimentation and have found that when commenting the following line, the problem is gone:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v30.0/src/qt/guiutil.cpp#L411\n\nThanks!",
