    "title": "Proxy Icon Tooltip Text",
    "body": "The Proxy Icon appears when a proxy is set up.  I believe the icon only shows if there are no clearnet connections.  (I unfortunately cannot test this right now because I do not have control of my firewall settings where I am and cannot set an incoming clearnet connection).  But maybe, the icon shows regardless of other connections? (If so, that should be another discussion).\r\n\r\nPlease see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/86#issuecomment-715496157 for the discussion.\r\n\r\nMy point being, maybe we should change the Proxy Icon Tooltip Text from \"Proxy is enabled\" to something like \"Connections are currently behind a Proxy\" - like I think we will be doing for the Tor Icon Tooltip Text.\r\n\r\nThe use case is for something like if `proxy=127.0.0.1:9050` and `listen=1` is set (against default), but clearnet incoming connections have not been made yet. We wouldn't want users to think that, although the connections are currently marked secure, that they will forever be secured.\r\n\r\nSee #110  for an issue for better configuration of the settings.\r\n\r\n",
