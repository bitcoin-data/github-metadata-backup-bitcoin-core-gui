    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs a Vertcoin miner, i get a lot of small payments due pools having a low minimum payout ammount, and all those transactions gets spammed to my Vertcoin Core wallet (which is based on Bitcoin Core), i have arrived to around 1500 transactions in a span of ~3 months, and now when i open my wallet, it freezes a little when loading all the transactions, it would be great if we could choose a transaction / a range of transactions and delete them from the wallet.\r\n\r\nI also thought about maybe a toggle option that is off by default, that allows you to \"keep only the transaction history from the past X days\"\r\n",
