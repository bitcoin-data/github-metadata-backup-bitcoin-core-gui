Especially when having many utxo's.\r\n\r\nSo user wants to use the automatic coin selection, but at the same time review the automatically selected coin(s). For example to check to not consolidate some specific coins (labels).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nCurrently, when coin control is enabled in the `Settings`, and the user doesn't select any coins himself, the automatic coin selection will select the coins.\r\n\r\nIf, _Enable coin control features_ is enabled, and user doesn't select any coins -> have a way/button to review the automatically selected coins, i.e. see the coinlist with selected coins for this tx.\r\n\r\nwith current workflow I'm not sure where to put it, suggestions welcome\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nSave psbt, and then `decodepsbt` RPC, but that doesn't give you the labels.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
