    "body": "I think it would be very professional and inspiring confidence, if the user could verify the settings from the command line/the config file(bitcoin.conf), in the running instance in the GUI.\r\n\r\nMaybe in the GUI window \"help\"->\"command line options\" for every option that sets a parameter, there could be a line inserted, that shows the current active value of this parameter.\r\n\r\nE.g. if one has set\r\nonlynet=tor\r\nin bitcoin.conf\r\nit would be nice IMHO, if the user could verify that this setting is active, in some window.\r\n\r\nMaybe even with a reason (e.g. state \"listen=0 because proxy parameter is set\")\r\n\r\nMoved from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8165.",
