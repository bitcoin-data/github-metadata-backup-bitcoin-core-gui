    "title": "Consider factoring out \"bitcoins\" string in AskPassphraseDialog",
    "body": "The Bitcoin-Qt GUI contains the word \"bitcoins\" in [two](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/34d1d6a112709cada2c415deae7f7989b2d8c2f3/src/qt/askpassphrasedialog.cpp#L111) [strings](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/34d1d6a112709cada2c415deae7f7989b2d8c2f3/src/qt/askpassphrasedialog.cpp#L119) in `AskPassphraseDialog`.  In the same spirit as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7192 , it would be nice to factor that out into a single constant string, so that translations are more consistent, and forks that call their coins something other than \"bitcoins\" can decrease their diff size relative to upstream.  Seems like maybe the `BitcoinUnits` class could be used for this, since it already [defines](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/efff9c3494a944a1a9288fec13e8bb5f23235920/src/qt/bitcoinunits.cpp#L69) the string \"Bitcoins\".",
