      "body": "I think Wayland is much stricter about loading the icon from the `.desktop` file (which must have an exactly matching name). I didn't test this any further, but running Wayland on my system with an appropriate `.desktop` file installed I do get the correct icon:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-12-10 20-36-06](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/6606587/a3e37606-d3e1-4382-a3a8-03dcbcc382b0)\r\n\r\nThat said, I added my .desktop file manually a while ago, and I notice now that on my machine the code which appears to write the .desktop file is **not being included** in the compilation, after being exluded by the C preprocessor. Specifically `Q_OS_LINUX` does not appear to have been set by `./configure`, so the code following this is skipped:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/36fabb01b16c70902c085187b0a6978c70c691c0/src/qt/guiutil.cpp#L574\r\nThis seems problematic to me, oir at least, I don't understand why on Linux this code is being excluded by the CPP.\r\n\r\nDid you try installing with `sudo make install`, or are you just running the binary as built by `make`? If you didn't install, you could try running `sudo make install; bitcoin-qt` and see if the installed version references the correct icon? (Note this will overwrite any previously-installed version).\r\n\r\nI've not worked on the GUI or QT much, so will defer to others here. For reference, my .desktop file in `/usr/local/share/applications` is in the form:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nwill@ubuntu /u/s/applications $ cat Bitcoin-qt.desktop\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nName=Bitcoin-Qt\r\nExec=/usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt\r\nIcon=/home/will/src/bitcoin/share/pixmaps/bitcoin64.png\r\nType=Application\r\nCategories=Utility;\r\n```\r\n",
