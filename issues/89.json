    "title": "[Discussion] Bitcoin Core logo",
    "body": "Wanted to open a discussion around the Bitcoin Core logo. Currently there is some inconsistencies in logo style / presentation as well as concerns around the currently used font. Having a more consistent logo assists with branding of Bitcoin Core as well as being important in preventing concerns over core 'controlling Bitcoin' as it will help it be seen as distinct from Bitcoin itself. I've also been doing some work around creating a Bitcoin Core design system of which branding will be a section covered, however I'll leave that for a separate discussion. \r\n\r\n# Icon + colorgraphy \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/tree/master/assets/images there exists a orange and black version, what would be considered the primary logo to to use to represent core? \r\n\r\nI'd personally lean towards using the black version with some white (for dark backgrounds) and minimalist (no circle) iterations, both are shown below. The idea here is to have some branding distinction between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin which the logo is a good way to achieve this. Why? Using the orange logo may confuse some people and think that Bitcoin Core IS Bitcoin - which is not the case. As mentioned above it is important for Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin to be distinct to prevent them being seen as the same entity. The original Bitcoin logo, in my view, should be used to symbolized the network itself not a product (such as the core GUI and related website bitcoincore.org) built on top of that network. Bitcoin core is currently the only product that uses the original logo as part of its branding (though some exceptions may apply such as bitcoin.org but this quite a different kind of entity to Bitcoin Core which ships tools users use). \r\n\r\nOne concern brought up by the Bitcoin Design community was this approach could make Bitcoin Core be seen as as a bitcoin fork, though I think this is unlikely. Many Bitcoin wallets exist with branding that could be confused as a fork, e.g. Blockstreams GreenWallet, but has not caused confusion from my understanding. \r\n\r\n# Font\r\n\r\nThe current logo uses Neue Helvetica font, which is a [licensed font](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/) - It may be worth switching to a free open source font to avoid issues. I've included one example, inter, below but I will be exploring some more. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/93116857-71336900-f6f0-11ea-89fd-3f9748af10ee.png)\r\n\r\nHere are some quick examples of a window in the GUI that could be changed for more consistent branding.\r\n\r\n## Launching GUI screen\r\n![Group 124](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/93116355-b99e5700-f6ef-11ea-81dc-95e36c085614.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So I hope the decisions made can also be implemented elsewhere. For example, on bitcoincore.org I see the orange symbol in the header and the black one in the footer. It also uses PT Sans for the site copy. The Bitcoin Core GUI user experience doesn't start with the desktop application, it starts with hearing that this exists and probably a journey either through bitcoin.org or bitcoincore.org to download and installation. All of those steps build on each other and form expectations and understanding. It would be great to review this whole journey and improve consistency based on what happens here.",

However, no other wallets that connect to the Bitcoin network use the orange bitcoin logo as their branding point and users generally aren't confused as to if they are connecting to BTC or some fork clone network. When you launch electrum for example do you think \"am I connecting to the electrum network or Bitcoin?\" I would imagine not.  \r\n\r\nI see the orange logo as adding more confusion as as it makes people think Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin are the same entity which is not the case. The on-boarding wizard designs I have done also help clarify things further by clearly explaining that the core wallet is connecting to the Bitcoin Network. \r\n\r\nThe color blind discussion was more around the fact you can run the GUI in different network modes (mainnet, testnet, regtest and soon signet) and how the mainnet color should be clearly distinct from all the other net's. Though this is really only a concern for developers. Switching nets within the GUI will likely be possible eventually, with which then this become more of a concern for end users - https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/78. If two nets look the same a user might think they are on mainnet but actually be on testnet and lose bitcoins by trying to send between networks. End users should not have to be aware of the various network types.",

The Bitcoin Core black logo is still used in some places, are you saying these should be orange also to prevent this false equivalence? I see both logos being used across Bitcoin Core applications as long as the context of its placement makes sense. I'm not suggesting changing the Bitcoin logo - I think that should stay as it is indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI understand your concerns but this is were we are now, Bitcoin Core is distinct from Bitcoin and we should make the best of it. \r\n\r\n> Bitcoin branding is great already ... Brand is orange. Bitcoin logo stays. Work with that limitation and improve.\r\n\r\nThis thread is focused on Bitcoin Core branding not Bitcoin - they are two distinct entities both with their own branding. Or do you think Bitcoin Core should just adopt the Bitcoin orange branding - maybe with a slight modification to make it distinct from Bitcoin? Thinking ahead Bitcoin Core may one day not be the only major software implementation for the BTC network - having distinct branding in this case makes sense.\r\n\r\n> Would be great if talented people such as Bosch-0 could focus design efforts on that and not on changing the only part of the design that works already.\r\n\r\nThese discussions may seem like bikeshedding to some but these are the kind of foundational design details need to be worked out prior to working on UI/UX. The logo inadvertently plays into how the rest of the design should look and feel - consistency is a key pillar in any good design. It would waste a lot of resources we don't have having to re-do designs if branding changed later.\r\n\r\nMy intention in making this thread was that the branding of Bitcoin Core is very unclear and inconsistent, which could be used by a malicious party to create this false equivalence gmaxwell mentioned. Having consistent branding also adds professionalism which for a project like Bitcoin Core, which essential powers a $246 billion dollar network, this matters a whole lot more than most would think. I also see having more professionalism as being useful in attracting more much needed support for the developers of this project.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to either go all in on an orange styled branding (I would recommend creating a slightly tweaked logo of the 'Bitcoin' logo for Bitcoin Core if going down this path) or the current black styling, rather then be in this middle ground were black is used someplace and orange in others.

This gives a much more softer, matte feeling which looks a lot cleaner and helps associated Core's logo more with Bitcoin outside of using the same B icon. \r\n\r\nThe open source font is inter for reasons explained in my original post. 'Bitcoin' is inter extra light and  'Core' is inter medium.\r\n\r\nAlthough I originally suggested to stick with the black I feel majority of people want orange. The Bitcoin icon uses a slight gradient giving it a much more 'designed' feel. This gradient is also a subtle way to distinguish Core from the more static orange styling used in the Bitcoin logo. The icon's B is also not transparent as it was in the original files and now has a white fill as seen in the dark logo.\r\n\r\nA grey scale would also be included as part of the branding package for various placements.

      "body": "> I think this (and the Inter font) is fine provided the chain icons and chain splash screen keep their different colors (as @MarcoFalke and I previously mentioned). My main regret is the accent on \"Core\" instead of \"Bitcoin\" even if it looks nice here.\r\n\r\nYep no changes should be made to the chain icons - I think we can all agree on that! I'm not sure I understand the concern around the splash screen? The current splash screen uses a variant of the traditional Bitcoin icon (one that isn't too visually appealing, the internal shadows look off - see here https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/147). The above logo also uses a variant of the traditional Bitcoin icon but looks cleaner - I did a quick mockup here https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/147#issuecomment-743042545 of a splash screen using the above icon variant. I don't think the gradient would confuse people as stated as a concern above. \r\n\r\n@RandyMcMillan The white background isn't part of the logo and yes the B is filled in white (it originally was not as you can see in the current splash screen). \r\n\r\nHere is the Roboto / Bitcoin emphasized variations. I think all the other variations can be worked out once we have a base (color, font, font weight) established. My vote goes towards the emphasized Bitcoin using inter font. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/101973378-99405300-3c72-11eb-9fd4-a5c5dc442926.png)\r\n\r\n@Rspigler Roboto Mono is a distinguished font as shown below - I'm not into this style of the logo fyi. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55287964/101973394-c2f97a00-3c72-11eb-839a-dda18bcbd1a1.png)\r\n\r\n",
