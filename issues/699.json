    "title": "Confusing/misleading \"Dust:\" label in coin selection dialog",
    "body": "The coin selection dialog in bitcoin-qt has a label named \"Dust:\":\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91535/213528695-70415942-6fef-48b5-89b0-335581ca9302.png)\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing, since in contrast to all other labels, the displayed information (yes/no) has literally nothing to do with the selected coins. All that this label shows is whether at least one of the _outputs_ qualify as dust, but the outputs are set in a different dialog. And even worse, the dust check is currently simply wrong because it only looks at an output's nValue and just assumes a P2PKH script size:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/250598a905a7be74d4064495c22e2423e371fe8a/src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp#L400-L402\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to simply remove it, but wanted to first discuss this here before opening a PR. Was the original intention maybe to apply the dust check to the _inputs_? (I.e. \"Is any of the selected inputs dust?\"). Does anyone find this shown information useful?",

If your coin choices end up requiring a change output smaller than the dust amount, it'll let you know:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"393\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116917595/213725267-8916d823-7c7f-492f-bc3d-62b3f533f213.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's grayed out because you haven't set any target output amounts. I guess a better (but overly verbose) label would be: \"Might this end up creating any dust outputs: \"\r\n\r\nI messed around for a minute or two trying to get it to turn red for the change output but with no success. Maybe due to `discard_rate` effects? Only when the manually-specified output value was below the threshold did it turn red and say \"yes\". But that shouldn't have anything to do with coin selection. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm inclined to agree that it should be removed for now. ",
