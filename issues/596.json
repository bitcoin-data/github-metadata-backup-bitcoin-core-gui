    "title": "RFC: Is it OK to reset unused prune and proxy settings to default values after restarting?",
    "body": "I'm opening this issue to get feedback and figure out how to resolve a disagreement that came up in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936#discussion_r850568749.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936 unifies Bitcoin-Qt and Bitcoind settings so they are stored in `<datadir>/settings.json` instead of externally (in windows registry or external config directories via QSettings). It fixes current behavior where Bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt can be started from the same datadir but may have inconsistent settings applied. It should make it easier to see what settings are in effect, because they will live in the datadir instead of being merged from outside sources. And it can enable new features like a `bitcoin-cli config` command that can update the unified settings dynamically.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the `<datadir>/settings.json` file does not currently store unused prune and proxy values when prune and proxy settings are disabled. So if you check the \"Prune block storage\" box and change the default \"2GB\" value to something else, then uncheck the box, then restart, then recheck the box, the previous value you typed will be lost, and the default \"2GB\" will be shown again. The same thing happens with the \"Connect through SOCKS5 proxy\" box. If you change the default tor proxy address \"localhost:9050\" to something else, and then disable the proxy, and restart, then recheck the box, the proxy address shown will be the default proxy address, not whatever proxy address you typed previously.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to change this behavior by storing unused proxy and prune settings somewhere. I don't personally think storing unused proxy or pruning settings values is a good thing or that it justifies extra complexity. But it would be possible to implement as a followup to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936. One approach I implemented in https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/4e86ab5dfc9bf40502aca0f9e3a4690f6f5dfc19 does this by adding `prune-prev` and `proxy-prev` settings that hold unused values when corresponding `prune` and `proxy` settings are disabled. Other approaches like storing unused prune and proxy settings in QSettings, or completely changing the representation of prune and proxy settings so they have \"enabled\" fields separate from the value fields would also be possible.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. What is ideal behavior when checking pruning/proxy boxes, typing pruning/proxy values, unchecking the boxes, restarting Bitcoin-Qt, checking the boxes again? Is it ideal to show default values (2GB and localhost:9050) when these boxes are checked? Or is ideal to show previous values? Or is some other behavior better?\r\n\r\n2. Is this issue important and should it block [#15936](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936)? Would it be ok for [#15936](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936) to implement simplest possible behavior of not saving unused prune and proxy values to disk, and displaying default pruning and proxy values when the boxes are checked after a restart?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nThese are the settings in question for reference\r\n![Screenshot_20220429_100134](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133040/165969806-688341c1-e074-4ba5-a8e6-c0059be2b4b5.png)\r\n![Screenshot_20220429_100104](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133040/165969843-9d55bec8-5643-47ee-a335-a6d46402fdbc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The question isn't really \"should option values be immediately reset to default as soon as they are disabled?\" but \"is it worth preserving disabled option values across restarts, and if so, how should those disabled option values be stored on disk?\"",

In terms of thinking about user-flows this situation should be rare, yet, it would be what the user expects. \"Hey bitcoin gui, why are you making me choose my prune target every time, I told you I want it to prune to 10gb if I'm running in pruned mode.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the same logic, the proxy settings provide a stronger case for restoring these values. While prune targets would rarely change, I'd assume it's an even rarer occurrence to change your proxy settings. And there are situations where you would cycle it off and on, especially if you're running the gui on a laptop, traveling and using different networks.\r\n\r\n",
