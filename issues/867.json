    "body": "### Issues, reports or feature requests related to the GUI should be opened directly on the GUI repo\n\n- [x] I still think this issue should be opened here\n\n### Report\n\nWhen PIE and LTO are combined, Qt applications crash at startup. See [Gentoo bug 954171](https://bugs.gentoo.org/954171). You can read all the gorey details about the underlying issue (that also affected Wireshark) [here](https://bugs.gentoo.org/754021). Basically, the issue is that Qt's `qcompilerdetection.h` prohibits building Qt with PIE because PIE breaks a critical assumption that Qt makes, but when a Qt application is built using LTO, the application's `-fPIE` flag overrides Qt's `-fPIC` flag and causes pieces of Qt to be optimized under the PIE model, which breaks it and causes it to segfault at runtime. The guard in `qcompilerdetection.h` is powerless to detect and prevent this because it's implemented by a preprocessor directive, and the preprocessor is not involved during LTO. To fix this, Bitcoin-Qt has to choose either LTO or PIE but not both. In Gentoo we plan to work around this for now by filtering out `-flto` from the user's flags, but it would be nicer to have an upstream solution.",

I can't reproduce the issue on Ubuntu 24.10 using GCC 14.2.0:\n```\n$ rm -rf build && cmake -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-flto -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-flto -DBUILD_GUI=ON\n$ cmake --build build -t bitcoin-qt\n$ ./build/bin/bitcoin-qt\n```\n\nThis suggests the issue may be specific to the default compiler options. If so, please consider updating the OP accordingly.\n\n3.

It just shows up worse with LTO because Qt's sanity check can't fire to tell you (at the point where the preprocessor is run, the right flags are in effect) and give you a build failure instead.\n\nThe way that CMake handles this (which is buggy, at least for Qt) means it doesn't show up without LTO, because it _does_ pass `-fPIC` almost all of the time, just not the whole time (does `-fPIE` when linking). If CMake just did `-fPIE` for everything, you'd get an error instead.",
