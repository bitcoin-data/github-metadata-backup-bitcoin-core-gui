    "body": "### Issues, reports or feature requests related to the GUI should be opened directly on the GUI repo\n\n- [x] I still think this issue should be opened here\n\n### Report\n\nWhen PIE and LTO are combined, Qt applications crash at startup. See [Gentoo bug 954171](https://bugs.gentoo.org/954171). You can read all the gorey details about the underlying issue (that also affected Wireshark) [here](https://bugs.gentoo.org/754021). Basically, the issue is that Qt's `qcompilerdetection.h` prohibits building Qt with PIE because PIE breaks a critical assumption that Qt makes, but when a Qt application is built using LTO, the application's `-fPIE` flag overrides Qt's `-fPIC` flag and causes pieces of Qt to be optimized under the PIE model, which breaks it and causes it to segfault at runtime. The guard in `qcompilerdetection.h` is powerless to detect and prevent this because it's implemented by a preprocessor directive, and the preprocessor is not involved during LTO. To fix this, Bitcoin-Qt has to choose either LTO or PIE but not both. In Gentoo we plan to work around this for now by filtering out `-flto` from the user's flags, but it would be nicer to have an upstream solution.",

I can't reproduce the issue on Ubuntu 24.10 using GCC 14.2.0:\n```\n$ rm -rf build && cmake -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-flto -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-flto -DBUILD_GUI=ON\n$ cmake --build build -t bitcoin-qt\n$ ./build/bin/bitcoin-qt\n```\n\nThis suggests the issue may be specific to the default compiler options. If so, please consider updating the OP accordingly.\n\n3.
