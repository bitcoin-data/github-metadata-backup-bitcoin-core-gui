    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nOn my Windows machine, the amount input field in the Send Coins dialog is extremely narrow (approximately 25 pixels wide). I can't see the amount I'm entering, see screenshot:\n\n<img width=\"739\" height=\"528\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a36aed1-def6-4696-adc4-4d86f3f26a46\" />\n\nMy Linux machine is not affected. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe amount field should be wide enough to display Bitcoin amounts clearly, as it was in v29.0.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n **To reproduce**\n  1. Open Bitcoin Core v30.0 on Windows\n  2. Go to Send tab\n  3. Try to enter an amount - the input field is barely visible\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv.30.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWin11 Pro 64bit\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nTested on: Dell XPS13 and HP Z2 mini G9 (both affected)\n- Display scaling: 100%\n- Screen resolution: 1920 x 1200 (laptop) and 1920Ã—1080 (workstation)\n- Locale: German\n",
