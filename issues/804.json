    "title": "Bitcoin core UI is unresponsive while syncing",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI'm running Fedora with a Wayland/Gnome desktop. Each time I start Bitcoin Core, it is completely unresponsive during the initial syncing period and continuously displays \"org.bitcoin.bitcoin-qt is not responding\" dialogs with Force quit / Wait options. If I keep clicking the Wait option, it will eventually finish syncing and work normally. It's acting like the UI is not able to respond to normal UI events while the backend is syncing but no other Gnome applications I use behave this way.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-09 16-26-05](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/660193/91195c6e-4879-48a8-a2d8-0e2931652390)\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nGUI app should be fully responsive to foreground UI events such as mouse clicks and keyboard actions even when the backend is busy syncing. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.Start Bitcoin Core on a Fedora Wayland/Gnome desktop and try to use it while it's syncing\r\n2. See endless \"not responding\" dialogs\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPackage manager\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n26.0-1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nFedora 38\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nIntel NUC 13 Pro NUC13VYKi7 ( 64GB RAM / 1TB SSD )\r\nFedora 38\r\nLinux kernel 6.7.7-100\r\nGnome 44.9\r\nbitcoin-core-desktop.x86_64   26.0-1.fc38",
