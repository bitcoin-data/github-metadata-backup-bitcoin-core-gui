    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI'm running Fedora with a Wayland/Gnome desktop. Each time I start Bitcoin Core, it is completely unresponsive during the initial syncing period and continuously displays \"org.bitcoin.bitcoin-qt is not responding\" dialogs with Force quit / Wait options. If I keep clicking the Wait option, it will eventually finish syncing and work normally. It's acting like the UI is not able to respond to normal UI events while the backend is syncing but no other Gnome applications I use behave this way.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-09 16-26-05](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/660193/91195c6e-4879-48a8-a2d8-0e2931652390)\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nGUI app should be fully responsive to foreground UI events such as mouse clicks and keyboard actions even when the backend is busy syncing. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.Start Bitcoin Core on a Fedora Wayland/Gnome desktop and try to use it while it's syncing\r\n2. See endless \"not responding\" dialogs\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPackage manager\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n26.0-1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nFedora 38\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nIntel NUC 13 Pro NUC13VYKi7 ( 64GB RAM / 1TB SSD )\r\nFedora 38\r\nLinux kernel 6.7.7-100\r\nGnome 44.9\r\nbitcoin-core-desktop.x86_64   26.0-1.fc38",

What I usually do after starting the UI is try to go to the Window -> Console menu to open the console so I can add my local bitcoin node (so it'll sync over local ethernet). When I first hit the Window menu is when I first notice the \"not responding\" dialog popup. Each time I hit wait, it will go away for a few seconds and if I'm quick and I perform an action or two before it pops up again. I'll investigate the other binaries when I get a chance. I'm not sure I want to try installing those over the Fedora binaries on my desktop box for fear of blowing up my wallet or something but I may be be able to try them out on another box.",

I'll need to figure out how to point it at my existing data. But, in any case, it's synced now so I can't reproduce the problem anymore. When it's fully synced, it starts right up and the UI works fine. Once it's a week or two out of date, I'll try it again and see if starting from the command line helps. If no one else is seeing this, feel free to close. Maybe it's something weird about Fedora 38 or my configuration. I need to update to Fedora 39 (or 40 soon) anyway...",
