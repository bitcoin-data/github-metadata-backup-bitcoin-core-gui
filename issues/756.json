Launch the `bitcoin-qt` application on any network.\r\n2. Ensure you have at least two wallets loaded. If needed, create additional wallets.\r\n3. Open the \"Receiving addresses\" (or \"Sending...\") window from the \"Windows\" menu at the top.\r\n4. Select a different wallet from the combo-box labeled \"Wallet:\" in the main application window.\r\n5. Once again, go to the \"Windows\" menu and select \"Receiving addresses\" (or \"Sending...\" depends on step 3).\r\n\r\nThis sequence of steps will open separate \"Receiving addresses\" (or \"Sending...\", depends on steps 3 & 5) windows with distinct lists of addresses. To create \"receiving addresses,\" click the \"Receive\" button located under the main menu at the top, which will open the receive coins dialog.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.99\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
