However we do not always find the change output which can cause us to unnecessarily add an additional output to the transaction. We can avoid this issue by outsourcing the determination of change to the user if they so desire.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `orig_change_pos` option to bumpfee which the user can use to specify the index of the change output.\r\n\r\nFixes #11233\r\nFixes #20795",

          "body": "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/688 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26687.\r\n\r\nFirst Issue Description (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/688):\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior for `getAvailableBalance`, when the coin control had selected coins, was to return the sum of them. Instead, we are currently returning the wallet's available total balance minus the selected coins total amount.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nMissed to update the `GetAvailableBalance` function to include the coin control selected coins on #25685.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nSince #25685 we skip the selected coins inside `AvailableCoins`, the reason is that there is no need to waste resources walking through the entire wallet's txes map just to get coins that could have gotten by just doing a simple `mapWallet.find`).\r\n\r\nPlaces Where This Generates Issues (only when the user manually select coins via coin control):\r\n1) The GUI balance check prior the transaction creation process.\r\n2) The GUI \"useAvailableBalance\" functionality.\r\n\r\nNote 1:\r\nAs the GUI uses a balance cache since https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/598, this issue does not affect the regular spending process. Only arises when the user manually select coins.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nAdded test coverage for the `useAvailableBalance` functionality.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nSecond Issue Description (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26687):\r\n\r\nAs we are using a cached balance on `WalletModel::getAvailableBalance`,\r\nthe function needs to include the watch-only available balance for wallets\r\nwith private keys disabled.\r\n",

          "title": "[WIP] wallet: standardize change output detection process",
          "body": "Depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27601, please go there first.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to define, and implement a base standard mechanism to\r\ndetect individual change outputs.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the wallet detects whether an output is change or not based\r\non data stored in the address book.\r\n\r\nThere is no notion of “change outputs”, the wallet detects change scripts.\r\n\r\nConnoting that any address book record modification has implications\r\non all the historical outputs related to that particular destination. Meaning\r\nthat all those outputs can either be change or not. There is no middle-ground\r\ngranular distinction.\r\n\r\n#### How Change Detection Currently Works?\r\n\r\nThe wallet walks-through the transaction outputs, extracts the script\r\ndestination and verify the following two points:\r\n\r\n1) If the destination doesn't exist in the address book, then the script\r\n    is a \"change address\".\r\n   \r\n2) If the destination exists in the address book, but it doesn't have a\r\n     label, then the script is a \"change address\".\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of problems in the current approach:\r\n\r\n- We make the wallet dependent on an external structure, with separate storage.\r\n   Which has to be updated and maintained along with the wallet state.\r\n\r\n- It cannot be maintained nor recovered across different wallet instances.\r\n   Cannot re-create the, possibly custom, address book data only by importing\r\n   the wallet descriptor string.\r\n\r\n- As the address book is an structure that the user can freely modify, the change\r\n   detection process might differ through different wallets.\r\n \r\n- The current rudimentary assumptions of \"no address book entry\" or \"no label set for the address book entry\"\r\n  to denote that certain script destination is change or not can easily be broken:\r\n  E.g. derive an address from one of the wallet’s external paths manually. Then send coins to it.\r\n  As the receive destination wasn't created inside the wallet, the wallet has no associated address book entry.\r\n  So, the reception is invalidly detected as change (added a test case for it).\r\n\r\n- The wallet can't detect change outputs on more complex scripts such as multi-sig change outputs.\r\n\r\n- The wallet is not able to detect change outputs going to an internal address if the internal address has a label.\r\n  (E.g. the user can manually set a label for the internal address and, doing that, make that all the change\r\n  outputs, in the wallet history, that were sent to the destination are no longer detected as change).\r\n\r\n- There isn’t a way to distinguish the external reception of coins into an internal address. Coins reception on any\r\n   internal address are always detected as change.\r\n\r\n### New Change Detection Mechanism Goals\r\n\r\nAiming to:\r\n\r\n* Define a base mechanism to align different wallet implementations. Preventing each piece of software\r\n  from diverging on the basic change outputs distinction.\r\n\r\n* Detect change outputs on-demand without requiring to maintain an external data structure synced with the\r\n   latest wallet state.\r\n\r\n* Independently, and accurately, detect change outputs regardless data stored in structures that the user\r\n   can freely modify.\r\n\r\n* Granular distinction between change vs non-change outputs that were sent to the same internal address.\r\n  E.g. the reception of coins, from an external source, on internal addresses will not longer be detected\r\n  as change anymore.\r\n\r\n* Expand the change detection to more complex scripts such as a multi-sig protected addresses. (While they\r\n  are added into the wallet on an internal spkm)\r\n\r\n#### Change Output Detection Rules\r\n\r\nA transaction output is change if it fulfills the following points:\r\n\r\n1) At least one of the parent transaction inputs is from the wallet. (If none of them are, then the wallet is receiving coins\r\n    on an internal address).\r\n\r\n2) The script extracted destination is from the wallet and is located in one of the internal script pub key manager.\r\n    (e.g. derived from an internal derivation path)\r\n\r\n#### What about legacy wallets?\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is HD post-split, we have an internal derivation path, so we can follow the same process as\r\ndescriptors wallet. Unless the destination is on the pre-split key pool, in which case, we fallback to the follow-up\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy wallet is pre-split, we continue using the address book as we either have an HD wallet with keys\r\nderived only on the external path, or we are using raw keypool.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### Extra Note\r\nThis PR, in about 85% at least, is about expanding the current test coverage for the change output detection area.\r\n\r\n#### TO DO (still WIP):\r\n\r\n* [x] Save “internal” flag on non-active descriptors so the wallet can use them on the change detection process.\r\n   (which will fix the currently failing test cases).\r\n* [ ] Re-organize commits so tests always pass.\r\n* [ ] Verify backwards compatibility.",

This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

Maybe something like this, but worded better:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"729\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116917595/214340781-62f1105a-a5b8-41ae-b96e-ac63e5207fc6.png\">\r\n \r\nMaybe the actual change _address_ isn't even needed, or could be revealed in a tooltip. \r\n\r\nAlso, if there's a single change output with sufficient funds for feebumping, then selecting \"none\" has basically no effect compared to selecting that output, as the wallet will always(?) deduct from that existing change output. Maybe this common case can be simplified by removing the \"None\" option?",

          "title": "Deniability - a tool to automatically improve coin ownership privacy",
          "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
