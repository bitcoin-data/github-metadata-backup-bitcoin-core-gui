    "body": "Fixes #551\r\n\r\nFor the simplest use case of a wallet with one external signer and \"PSBT Controls\" disabled in settings (the default), the send dialog will behave the same as when using a wallet with private keys. I.e. there's no \"Create Unsigned\" button.\r\n\r\nWhen PSBT controls are turned on, you can now actually make a PSBT with signing it; before this PR that button would trigger a sign event and would broadcast the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn case a multisig, the Send button will sign on the device, and then fall back to presenting a PSBT (same behavior as before #441).\r\n\r\nThis PR starts with two refactoring commits to move some stuff into a helper function for improved readability in general, and to make the main commit easier to review.",
