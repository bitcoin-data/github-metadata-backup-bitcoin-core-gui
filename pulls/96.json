I don't think it was user-friendly enough for that.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"403\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2020-09-18 om 09 41 44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/93574129-52ef9680-f998-11ea-9a6f-31144f66d3bf.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a few simple improvements so that new users don't have to think too much:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2020-10-15 om 16 45 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/96145959-0c914700-0f06-11eb-9526-cf447d841d7a.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's lightly inspired by #77. It would be better if those changes made it into the upcoming release, but this PR is a good start imo.\r\n\r\n* wallet encryption is no longer checked by default, because such a change in the default needs a separate discussion (fwiw, I suspect it increases the number of users losing access to coins)\r\n* watch-only and descriptor wallet stuff is moved to advanced, so new users know they can safely ignore these check boxes\r\n* bonus: when you click on \"disable private keys\" it disables encrypt wallet and checks blank wallet\r\n* label changes: see screenshot\r\n* tooltip changes: see code diff\r\n\r\nNote that a blank wallet name isn't allowed in the dialog; I haven't addressed that.\r\n\r\n_Update 2020-10-30_, dropped the new strings for now:\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2020-10-30 om 11 26 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/97694591-1b99fc80-1aa3-11eb-8b85-e19f1ad5add4.png\">\r\n",

The wallet isn't being encrypted only the private keys from my understanding - though I think wallet contents a long with meta data like tx history should also be encrypted at some point (again, this is also a familiar process to many users).

      "body": "@joernroeder \r\n\r\n> I don't like the idea to disable the encryption by default and would prefer a \"fail safe\" strategy here.\r\n\r\nFYI, no released version of Bitcoin Core has ever created encrypted wallets by default; this PR just preserves that legacy.\r\n\r\nAs background, there's an open question between experts about whether or not the use of wallet encryption in typical user wallets saves more money than it loses.  It saves money if someone gets a hold of just your wallet file (if they get direct access to your computer, they can observe your passphrase and steal your funds any way).  It loses money if you forget your passphrase.  Some experts believe the number of occasions where a wallet file has fallen into a attacker's hands without that attacker getting direct access to the user's computer is small compared to the large number of occasions where a user has forgotten their passphrase, so it's on average safer not to use encryption.\r\n\r\n(I don't hold a strong opinion here myself.  I assume that any bitcoins stored in my hot wallet will be stolen someday and prefer leaving my wallet unencrypted so I'm likely to learn about the theft as early as possible.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also like @GBKS's suggested label rename to `Manually import seed or keys`.",

All that we need is to realize that the GUI repo is a new home for collaboration of devs and [designers](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign). Code is devs' responsibility. Look-and-feel is designers' responsibility. Let's rely on opinion of designers (@Bosch-0 and @GBKS in this particular PR).\r\n\r\nLet bikeshedding be designers' burden :)",

What I want is for new users to ignore these options, which is why I put them under \"advanced\". What I don't want to do is change the text once, and then change it back, and then change it again and miss the feature freeze deadline. The net result of that is keeping the unsafe version (with encryption enabled by default).

That makes sense to me when `Manually import...` was originally labelled `Blank Wallet` - but you can't import seed or keys to a watch-only wallet, so this seems like an error.  Because of this, I think naming it back to `Blank Wallet` makes more sense?\r\n\r\nUnchecking `Watch-only` re-enables `Encrypt private keys`, and keeps `Manually import seed or keys enabled`. :heavy_check_mark:\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a wallet that has `Watch-only` enabled, and one that has `Watch-only` and `Manually import seed or keys` enabled? In other words, should unchecking `Manually import seed or keys` also uncheck `Watch-only`? I believe so, and this is another reason why remaining `Manually import seed or keys` to `Blank Wallet` makes more sense IMO. (Unchecking `Blank Wallet` should uncheck `Watch-only`).\r\n\r\nI also like @ryanofsky 's suggestion of `Skip seed generation`.\r\n\r\nBut I also understand I am coming in late, and there has been frustrations over bikeshedding.\r\n\r\n",

Main motivation seems be avoiding adding a translation string (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/96#discussion_r522738216), but the new commit increases the scope of the PR beyond \"slightly improving the create wallet dialog\", to adding a GUI feature: creating and encouraging creation of a top level unnamed wallet which contains other wallets. I don't think the change is great, but even if it were a good idea, I think it would make more sense in its own feature PR, not a PR that's just consisted of dialog box tweaks up to this point and is still described that way.",

It makes sense that it didn't allow a blank wallet name, because it would never be used to create the initial wallet.\r\n\r\nThe PR description of  bitcoin/bitcoin#15454 says (emphasis mine):\r\n> Instead of **automatically** creating and loading a default wallet, users should instead explicitly create their wallet or load it on start.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't clear to me that intention of that PR was to get rid of the unnamed wallet entirely. It seemed more like an oversight to me.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't object to ditching the unnamed wallet. But it does create the annoying problem of the user having to pick a name.\r\n\r\nI can drop the last commit (or the maintainer can just omit it from the merge) if needed.",

      "body": "PR title \"Slight improve create wallet dialog\" title is currently misleading. Right now this PR is also adding back ability to create a top-level unnamed wallet containing other wallets from the GUI that was removed in #15454 (definitely intentional for me, though I can't speak for other participants).\r\n\r\nI don't think commit 03ebe1b5938a73b41e34a1251520a2db29fafd95 is a good idea. I think it is confusing for a wallet to contain other wallets. I think wallets that are unnamed are more likely to get lost and not backed up properly than wallets that have recognizable names. I think if the last commit 03ebe1b5938a73b41e34a1251520a2db29fafd95 is desirable at all, it should be a standalone PR, which should have some rationale stating why it is desirable. It shouldn't be tacked on to a PR doing other cleanup as an extra commit with no rationale or description. Even from discussion in this PR, I haven't seen any justification of the commit, except as workaround to avoid adding a translation string.\r\n\r\nIt seems fine to just drop the placeholder string if we can't have a translation now and don't want an untranslated string. I think commit 03ebe1b5938a73b41e34a1251520a2db29fafd95 is beyond scope of this PR.",

Perhaps remove this auto-checking, or maybe append ` (auto-selects \"Make Blank Wallet\")` to the watch-only text to make clear to users what is going on, but the dialog may need to be larger to accomodate that.\r\n  \r\n> For a followup, here's the last list of strings I used:\r\n> \r\n> > Encrypt private keys:\r\n> > Private keys in the wallet will be encrypted with a passphrase of your choice. Addresses, transaction history and notes are not encrypted.\r\n> \r\n> > Watch-only\r\n> > Disable private keys for this wallet. Watch-only wallets have no private keys and cannot have an HD seed or imported private keys.\r\n\r\nFor now or later, I like these two changes.\r\n\r\n> Another minor question: Why `PascalCase` in the placeholder?\r\n\r\nHad the same thought.

      "body": "@ryanofsky I still don't understand what you mean with \"wallet to contain other wallets\". It's just one wallet.\r\n\r\nI dropped the last commit. To the degree it wasn't clear whether disallowing the `\"\"` wallet was intentional, it is now :-)\r\n\r\nI changed \"MyWallet\" to \"Wallet\" to avoid CamelCase and at the same avoid spaces in directory names, which tend to trip up badly written backup commands. For future versions we can translate it, but I suggest hinting to the translators to avoid spaces. Unicode characters (e.g. Angličtina)  are probably fine, because afaik we have tests for those. But Arab seems to have a space:  محفظة نقود\r\n\r\nI don't think dropping the placeholder completely, yet not allowing a blank name, is a good idea: users won't know why Create is disabled and they'll probably start selecting random options. (that might still happen, but the placeholder gives at least some hint that picking a name is mandatory)\r\n\r\nOf course it's just a placeholder text so the user might type something completely different. I'm still not a fan of forcing users to pick a name, but agree it should be out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n> Clicking on the watch-only option does indeed auto-check the blank wallet option but also violates the principle of least surprise\r\n\r\nIt's similar to the pre-existing behaviour of clicking on Encrypt wallet. Explaining the behaviour better makes sense, but since I can't change the strings, that would be for a followup (I also don't want to risk whack-a-mole by touching window size, though that's probably safe).",

Tested creating a dozen wallets in signet with different combinations of options and then verifying/comparing their characteristics in the console with getwalletinfo. My remaining caveats are (1) the need for less user surprise by either (a) improving the user info or (b) with less auto-(un)selecting as mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/96#issuecomment-727017409 and (2) I prefer the \"Encrypt private keys\" and \"Watch-only\" wording and descriptions below over the current ones; hopefully these can be addressed in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n>Clicking on the watch-only option does indeed auto-check the blank wallet option but also violates the principle of least surprise and may look to many users like a bug in the code, which may reduce user confidence in the wallet. Perhaps remove this auto-checking, or maybe append ` (auto-selects \"Make Blank Wallet\")` to the watch-only text to make clear to users what is going on, but the dialog may need to be larger to accomodate that.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> > For a followup, here's the last list of strings I used:\r\n> > > Encrypt private keys:\r\n> > > Private keys in the wallet will be encrypted with a passphrase of your choice. Addresses, transaction history and notes are not encrypted.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > > Watch-only\r\n> > > Disable private keys for this wallet. Watch-only wallets have no private keys and cannot have an HD seed or imported private keys.\r\n>\r\n> For now or later, I like these two changes.\r\n",
