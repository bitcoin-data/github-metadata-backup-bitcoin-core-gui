We typically glance over the chart as a whole to get a gist of the network traffic. So there is a risk of possible misinterpretation, even for an individual user.\r\n\r\nThough @reboard has addressed this in [this](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/484#issuecomment-983795490) comment, I still think this is a bad UX design. And personally, for me, the possible declination in the user's experience outweighs the functionality this PR is introducing.\r\n",
