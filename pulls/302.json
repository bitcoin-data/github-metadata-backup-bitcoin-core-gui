See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\nI have linked the original bitcoin whitepaper to README.md\r\n\r\nOfficial bitcoin whitepaper -> https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf",

There are a lot of open issues of any difficulty waiting to be fixed. However, before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit and functional tests. Once that is done, you are all set.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help getting started, please refer to the following resources:\r\n\r\n* https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365\r\n* https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core\r\n\r\n### Pick something to work on\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for useful contributions to help out with, you can\r\n\r\n* Search through the [good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)s or the ones that are [up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\r\n* Write tests to improve the coverage. Any kind of test is welcome and coverage information can be obtained from a relatively recent [coverage report](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov). If you are unsure, don't hesitate to check back first.\r\n* Help with review and testing. There are easy ones such as the [gui](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AGUI) and [rpc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ARPC%2FREST%2FZMQ). However, review on any open pull request is welcome. Review will also help you understand the codebase better.\r\n* Help on meta projects related to Bitcoin Core, such as a [high-level performance monitor](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf).\r\n* Join us on irc and let us know what you are interested in.",
