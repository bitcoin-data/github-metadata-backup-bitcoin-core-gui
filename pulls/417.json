      "body": "@ryanofsky \r\n\r\n> The first commit \"qt: Ditch wallet model juggling\" ([f3e7047](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/commit/f3e70479257770bc9f61de694db8704140139548)) is more confusing, because it seems like the new code is doing the same thing as the old code, just making slightly different function calls to do the same thing. This is probably ok, but it would be helpful if commit message said whether this is just supposed to be a local code cleanup, or a bigger change that affects other code. Also that commit seems to delete comments which I think are helpful about _why_ particular threads are assigned. The new comment says what thread is assigned but not why.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't do the same thing as before since `WalletModel` constructor is executed in the GUI thread whereas before it was executed in the wallet controller background thread or on the RPC handling thread. This change makes loading big wallets block the GUI. But this blocking issue is \"fixed\" in the following commit.\r\n\r\nIn terms of Qt calls, it avoids `moveToThread` and `setParent`, since now `WalletModel` is instanced in the GUI thread with the right parent.\r\n\r\n> IIUC, the second commit \"qt: Move wallet preloading out of model constructors\" ([e2ffc98](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/commit/e2ffc98e73df68d0de9755d2ebbb26daa17c92fc)) seems like a good change, moving wallet \"preloading\" tasks off of the GUI thread into timer threads or notification callback threads. But I'm not 100% sure this is what it is doing. Would be helpful if the commit description said what loading behavior was before the change and how it is different afterward.\r\n\r\nSo, the `WalletModel` constructor instantiated the remaining models (like `TransactionTableModel`) and those models would load everything from `interfaces::Wallet`. This happened on the wallet controller background thread or the RPC handling thread, depending on how the wallet was loaded. So, the `WalletModel` constructor could block for a while for big wallets - that was the reason for not instantiating the model in the GUI thread.\r\n\r\nThis commit splits instancing models and loading data. Instancing models still happens on the GUI thread while loading data happens on a separate thread. This \"fixes\" the blocking issue introduced in the 1st commit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that, even though `preload` happens on a background thread, we can have a blocked GUI because underneath loading locks some mutexes that other parts of the GUI could also try to lock. For instance, `WalletImpl::getWalletTxs` locks `cs_wallet`, and the more transactions the worse.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the loading split from the instancing, we can improve the loading for big wallets. For instance:\r\n - load transactions only when the user opens the transactions list, same for addresses, etc\r\n - adopt a lazy loading approach\r\n - chunked loading where locks don't get locked for so long.\r\n - read-write locks (?)",

      "body": "In commit \"qt: Ditch wallet model juggling\" (f3e70479257770bc9f61de694db8704140139548)\r\n\r\nIt seems unfortunate that this commit is deleting previous comment which explained what this code was trying to do, replacing it with a much shorter comment that doesn't provide much explanation.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to combine two comments with something like:\r\n\r\n> // Instantiate WalletModel in the thread that created the WalletControllet object (GUI main thread), instead of the current thread, which could be an outside wallet thread or RPC thread sending a LoadWallet notification. This ensures queued signals sent to the WalletModel object will be handled on the GUI event loop.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also think commit message is unclear about what behavior is changing. Initially I didn't realize that constructing the WalletModel was so expensive and actually loaded transactions, so this at first appeared to be a no-op change that was replacing setParent and moveToThread calls with a constructor call. Would suggest adding an explanation like the following to the commit message:\r\n\r\n> qt: Ditch wallet model juggling \r\n>\r\n> Construct WalletModel on the GUI thread, not on the outside thread which loaded the wallet. This is a simplification because it avoids the need to make setParent and moveToThread calls after the wallet is constructed. This commit however can cause GUI freezes while loading the wallet because the WalletModel constructor can take a long time to run if the wallet contains a lot of transactions. The GUI freeze issue is addressed by making WalletModel initialization more asynchronous in the next commit.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as an alternative, if you switch the order of the two commits, you could drop \"This commit however can cause GUI freezes...\" part and everything after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
