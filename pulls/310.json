If an icon is not being used it should be removed. \r\n\r\nIf a developer working on a new features requires an icon not currently available in the [Bitcoin Icon set](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Icons) they should [open an issue](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Icons/issues) in that repo requesting an icon to be designed. \r\n\r\nSVG are to be added to `src/qt/res/src` directory, and a optimized production file (PNG) must be included under `src/qt/res/icons` directory.\r\n\r\n```",
