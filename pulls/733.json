    "body": "This new feature is an implementation of the ideas in Paul Sztorc's blog post \"Deniability - Unilateral Transaction Meta-Privacy\"(https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deniability/).\r\n\r\nIn short, the idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the GUI portion of the PR (bitcoin-core/gui). The core functionality PR ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27792 ) is in the main repo (bitcoin/bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \r\n\r\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\r\n\r\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats). Since we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a backup, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_initial\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/6626cca3-1b96-4ccd-9463-2a91a9993faa\">\r\n\r\nThe user has a couple of controls for the \"deniabillization\" process - a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform a cycle (see below) and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_pick_budget_frequency\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/7508c23f-2ebb-4345-a440-49b9f60b8412\">\r\n\r\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing the Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). \r\nThe first time the button is pressed, we offer an information / confirmation box to explain to the user how Deniability works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"deniability_view_start_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/c08ee856-8736-4e4e-be71-28219735f764\">\r\n\r\nThe process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). In each such cycle we do the following: \r\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected. If a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_tx_awaiting_confirmation\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/df0354dc-f60f-45db-b692-db5c6ca36253\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"transaction_view_after_deniabilization\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/709084d3-227d-4c0d-ac47-cd83433b992a\">\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis. The state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"deniability_view_next_cycle_countdown\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/123340139/da5a71e1-0174-4f2a-a9b3-b8a635abe769\">\r\n\r\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx). We don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\r\n\r\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\r\n\r\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the deniabilization processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for ideas if we can improve this in some way.\r\n\r\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\r\n\r\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main functions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I did my best to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there may be things I've missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nIn particular one thing I'm not particularly happy with - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store wallet specific data keyed on wallet name, however wallets can be erased and new ones created with the same name, so this is not ideal. I made an effort to validate all data on load, but it would be great if we could improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API). Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

'Budget' should be called 'Fee Budget'.\r\n2. There should be an option to select \"random\" frequency.\r\n3. There should be an option to select minimum amount for resulting UTXOs so that user doesn't end up with dust outputs that need to be used together.\r\n4. Post deniability UTXOs have to be carefully spent but there is nothing to differentiate them in the labels and all are labelled as \"deniability\". Users will need to do manual analysis before spending which is not good UX.\r\n5. I don't understand why the next cycle starts after 1 hr 34 minutes when frequency is 1 hour: https://i.imgur.com/fxE0AvG.png",

      "body": "@1440000bytes, \r\nThank you so much for testing the PR and for the feedback. That's very helpful. \r\n\r\n(1) Yes, that's a good idea, I'll rename it.\r\n(2) and (5) are related. The selectable frequencies are actually also randomized, within the selected frequency range - for example hourly is random from 1 to 2 hours, daily is random from 1 to 2 days etc (see line 934 in deniabilitydialog.cpp). Perhaps we need to rename the frequency UI selection to something that better describes this?\r\n(3) Great idea as well - especially since we're getting into long stretches of overloaded mempool with fees sky rocketing. I'm actually even more concerned that any number the user picks, may not be good enough long term, as smaller UTXOs may effectively become dust if fees rise and stay elevated (and there's a good chance that's going to happen). I'm not sure we can solve that just on the transaction end though ... A minimum UTXO amount does sound like a good option regardless, so I'll implement that.\r\n(4) Indeed - I'll have to think how to solve this. Perhaps we need to add some \"deniability\" awareness to the regular UTXO selection logic. I'm not entirely clear what that logic would look like though. Let me know if you have ideas - eg, what kind of rules for UTXO selection should we add etc.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit busy with my main job at the moment, but when I get a chance I'll work on this as time allows.\r\nThanks!",

Here I'll just copy the relevant context for the wallet API changes:\n\n\"\nIn short, Paul's idea is to periodically split coins and send them to yourself, making it look like common \"spend\" transactions, such that blockchain ownership analysis becomes more difficult, and thus improving the user's privacy.\nI've implemented this as an additional \"Deniability\" wallet view. The majority of the code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up to the WalletView class. \n\"\n\nWhile the Deniability dialog can be implemented entirely with the existing API, adding the core \"deniabilization\" functions to the CWallet and interfaces::Wallet API allows us to implement the GUI portion with much less code, and more importantly allows us to add RPC support and more thorough unit tests.\n\n-----\nImplemented basic deniability unit tests to wallet_tests\n\n-----\nImplemented a new 'walletdeniabilizecoin' RPC.\n\n-----\nImplemented fingerprint spoofing for deniabilization (and fee bump) transactions.\nCurrently spoofing with data for 6 different wallet implementations, with 4 specific fingerprint-able behaviors (version, anti-fee-sniping, bip69 ordering, no-rbf).\n\n-----\nImplemented CalculateDeniabilizationFeeEstimate and CalculateDeniabilizationCycles as non-recursive functions.",

The majority of the GUI code is in a new deniabilitydialog.cpp/h source files containing a new DeniabilityDialog class, hooked up via the WalletView class. \n\nOn startup and on notable events (new blocks, new transactions, etc), we evaluate the privacy of all coins in the wallet, and we build a \"deniabilization\" candidate list. UTXOs that share the same destination address are grouped together into a single candidate (see DeniabilityDialog::updateCoins and DeniabilityDialog::updateCoinTable).\n\nWe inspect the blockchain data to find out if we have performed \"deniabilization\" transactions already, and we count how many \"cycles\" (self-sends) have been performed for each coin (see DeniabilityDialog::calculateDeniabilizationStats).\nSince we infer the state entirely from the blockchain data, even if the wallet is restored from a seed phrase, the state would not be lost. This also means that if the user has performed manual self-sends that have improved the ownership privacy, they will be counted too.\n\nThe user can initiate the \"deniabillization\" process by pressing a Start button (DeniabilityDialog::startDeniabilization). The process periodically perform a \"deniabilization\" cycle (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeProc). Each such cycle goes as follows:\nA coin is selected form the candidate list. The more a coin is \"deniabilized\", the less likely it is to be selected. Smaller coins are also less likely to be selected.\nIf a coin is selected, we prepare and broadcast a transaction, which splits the coin into a pair of new wallet addresses (DeniabilityDialog::deniabilizeCoin). \n\nThe user can control this process via a Frequency selector and a Budget spinner, which respectively determine how often to perform the cycle and how much total BTC to spend on transaction fees.\n\nIf Bitcoin Core is left running continuously, the cycles would be performed at the selected frequency (with some randomization). If Bitcoin Core is shutdown, the \"deniabilization\" process will resume at the next restart, and if more time has elapsed than the selected frequency, it will perform a single cycle. We deliberately don't \"catch up\" all missed cycles, since that would expose the process to blockchain analysis.\nThe state is saved and restored via QSettings (DeniabilityDialog::loadSettings and DeniabilityDialog::saveSettings).\n\nWe monitor each broadcasted transaction and we automatically attempt a fee bump if the transaction is still in the memory pool since the previous cycle (DeniabilityDialog::bumpDeniabilizationTx).\nWe don't issue any other deniabilization transactions until the previous transaction is confirmed (or abandoned/dropped).\n\nThe process ends when the budget is exhausted or if there's no candidates left. The user can also stop the process manually by pressing a Stop button (DeniabilityDialog::stopDeniabilization).\n\nExternal signers are supported in a \"best effort\" way - since the user needs to manually sign, we postpone the processing till the external signer is connected and use some additional UI to get the user's attention to sign (see the codepath predicated on hasExternalSigner). This is not ideal, so I'm looking for some ideas if we can improve this in some way.\n\nWatch-only wallets are partially supported, where we display the candidate list, but we don't allow any processing (since we don't have the private keys to issue transactions).\n\nI've tested all this functionality on regtest, testnet, signet and mainnet. I've also added some unit tests (under WalletTests) to exercise the main GUI functionality.\n\nThis is my first change and PR for Bitcoin Core, and I tried as much as possible to validate everything against the guidelines and documentation and to follow the patterns in the existing code, but I'm sure there are things I missed, so I'm looking forward to your feedback.\nIn particular things I'm not very sure about - the save/restore of state via QSettings makes me a bit nervous as we store some wallet specific data there which I put some effort to validate on load, however keying the settings based on wallet name is not ideal, so I'd like to improve this somehow - either by storing the settings based on some wallet identity signature, or by storing the state in the wallet database (however that doesn't seem accessible via the interfaces::Wallet API).\nPlease let me know your thoughts and suggestions.\n\n-----\nRefactored the coin update to explicitly match utxos by scriptPubKey and not rely on the ListCoin destination grouping.\n\n-----\nFixed linter error about bitcoin-config.h not being included.\n-----\nPost-rebase fixes for cmake build.\n-----\nRefactored deprecated hex from string conversions.",
