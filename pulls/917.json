    "body": "This PR improves several Chinese translations related to peer connection types in the\r\nBitcoin Core Qt GUI. The existing translations contain a mix of literal interpretations\r\nand colloquial wording that can be misleading or unclear in a technical networking UI.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n- \"Manual\" was translated as \"手册\", which commonly refers to documentation in Chinese.\r\n  In Bitcoin Core, \"Manual\" indicates a peer connection that was manually established.\r\n  This PR updates the translation to \"手动连接\" to accurately reflect its meaning.\r\n\r\n- \"Feeler\" was translated as \"触须\", a literal but biological metaphor that does not\r\n  clearly convey its function. Feeler connections are short-lived probes used to test\r\n  peer reachability. The translation is updated to \"探测连接\", which is a commonly\r\n  understood networking term.\r\n\r\n- \"Address Fetch\" was translated as \"地址取回\", which implies retrieving previously\r\n  owned data. In reality, this connection type requests known addresses from a peer.\r\n  The translation is updated to \"地址获取\" for accuracy and clarity.\r\n\r\n- \"Inbound\" was translated as \"進來\", a colloquial verb that is not suitable as a UI\r\n  label. \"Inbound\" describes a peer-initiated connection direction and is commonly\r\n  represented as \"传入\" in Chinese networking terminology (paired with \"传出\" for\r\n  outbound connections). This change also aligns with terminology used in other locale\r\n  files.\r\n\r\nThese updates improve clarity, technical accuracy, and consistency across the Chinese\r\nUI, reducing potential user confusion without affecting any consensus or networking\r\nlogic.\r\n",
