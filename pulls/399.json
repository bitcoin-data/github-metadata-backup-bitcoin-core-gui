    "body": "This PR provides a fix to the issue mentioned in #232. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the **_Load PSBT_** functionality works well in case a wallet is loaded but does nothing when a wallet isn't loaded. \r\n\r\nIf a function cannot work without a wallet being loaded, it is disabled by default (It is unclickable as shown in the image). \r\n\r\nFor e.g. One cannot `Close Wallet` or `Backup Wallet` or `Sign Messages` without a wallet being loaded. And hence they are disabled. But if you notice, `Load PSBT` options are not disabled by default even when a wallet isn't loaded.\r\n\r\n>  ![Screenshot 2021-08-07 at 11 46 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54016434/128610208-45376026-0e91-4268-abdf-342e3cec5917.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by hebasto in the issue description : \r\n\r\n``` \r\n<hebasto> achow101: does \"File\" -> \"Load PSBT from {file|clipboard}\" make any sense when no wallet is loaded?\r\n<achow101> hebasto: yes, for finalize and sending\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means **_Load PSBT_**  should be working just as similar whether wallets are being loaded or not. \r\n\r\nAfter making the required changes to the code, The **_Load PSBT_** works as expected even with no wallet loaded and the PSBT is finalized. \r\n\r\n| Master | PR | \r\n|-------------|---------------|\r\n| ![Hnet com-image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54016434/128611454-4dfc3fd3-ecc0-48f0-8408-60eb98035694.gif) | ![Hnet com-image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54016434/128611461-982468d2-9cd0-4f9b-9392-c25b6c8857e2.gif) | \r\n\r\n\r\nClose #232 ",
