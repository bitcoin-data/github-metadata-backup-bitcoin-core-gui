    "body": "This pull request brings substantial enhancements to the `TrafficGraphWidget`, making it far more useful, flexible, and user-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements:\r\n1. **Enhanced visualization** – improved scaling (including logarithmic option) and new tooltips showing detailed traffic data on hover.\r\n2. **Persistent traffic data** – traffic history is now preserved between sessions, eliminating the need to start from scratch each time.\r\n3. **Flexible time ranges** – support added for smooth transitions between multiple sample ranges (from 5 minutes to 28 days).\r\n4. **Improved time handling** – new utility functions provide better timestamp accuracy and millisecond precision.\r\n5. **Qt6 compatibility** – deprecated Qt5 mouse event methods updated for modern Qt6 APIs.\r\n\r\n### Why this matters:\r\nWithout these improvements, the `TrafficGraphWidget` loses all historical data every time the sample range is changed. This severely limits its usefulness in real-world usage, as most users are likely to stick to just one fixed time range to avoid losing data. This update solves that issue by persisting traffic data across time range changes, allowing users to freely zoom in for short-term analysis or zoom out to view long-term trends—**without data loss**.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this version supports using the **left and right arrow keys** to switch seamlessly between time ranges, making navigation even easier.\r\n\r\nI've included a video in the PR description showcasing the updated traffic graph in action, so you can see the improvements for yourself.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebased and significantly improved version of #559, targeting the latest `core/master`.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/775c9e12-3722-4d43-8eb5-a832589eb13d\r\n\r\n",

Multiple timeframe support - View traffic data across different time\n   periods (5 minutes to 28 days) using an enhanced slider interface\n\n2. Traffic data persistence - Save and restore traffic information\n   between sessions, preserving historical traffic patterns\n\n3. Interactive visualization features:\n   - Logarithmic scale toggle (mouse click) for better visualization of\n     varying traffic volumes\n   - Interactive tooltips showing detailed traffic information at specific points\n   - Yellow highlight indicators for selected data points\n\n4. Smooth transitions between different time ranges with animated scaling\n\nThese improvements allow users to better monitor and analyze network\ntraffic patterns over time, which is especially useful for debugging\nconnectivity issues or understanding network behavior under different\nconditions.\n\nThe implementation includes proper thread-safety considerations and\nhandles edge cases like time jumps or missing data appropriately.\n",

Multiple timeframe support - View traffic data across different time\n   periods (5 minutes to 28 days) using an enhanced slider interface\n\n2. Traffic data persistence - Save and restore traffic information\n   between sessions, preserving historical traffic patterns\n\n3. Interactive visualization features:\n   - Logarithmic scale toggle (mouse click) for better visualization of\n     varying traffic volumes\n   - Interactive tooltips showing detailed traffic information at specific points\n   - Yellow highlight indicators for selected data points\n\n4. Smooth transitions between different time ranges with animated scaling\n\nThese improvements allow users to better monitor and analyze network\ntraffic patterns over time, which is especially useful for debugging\nconnectivity issues or understanding network behavior under different\nconditions.\n\nThe implementation includes proper thread-safety considerations and\nhandles edge cases like time jumps or missing data appropriately.",
