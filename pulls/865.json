    "body": "This PR includes several improvements to the TrafficGraphWidget:\r\n\r\n1. Enhanced traffic graph visualization with improved scaling and tooltips\r\n2. Added persistence for traffic data between sessions\r\n3. Improved time handling with new utility functions\r\n4. Added support for multiple time ranges with smooth transitions\r\n5. Updated deprecated Qt5 mouse event methods for Qt6 compatibility\r\n\r\nKey improvements:\r\n- Added tooltips showing detailed traffic information when hovering over data points\r\n- Implemented data persistence to maintain traffic history between application restarts\r\n- Added new utility functions for time formatting and millisecond precision\r\n- Improved graph scaling with logarithmic option for better visualization of varying traffic levels\r\n- Updated mouse event handling to use modern Qt6 APIs\r\n- Added support for multiple time ranges (5min to 28 days) with smooth transitions\r\n- Improved data accuracy with better timestamp handling\r\n\r\nThis is a rebase of #559 for the latest core/master, with significant improvements to the traffic graph widget's functionality and user experience.",

Traffic data persistence - Save and restore traffic information\n   between sessions, preserving historical traffic patterns\n\n3. Interactive visualization features:\n   - Logarithmic scale toggle (mouse click) for better visualization of\n     varying traffic volumes\n   - Interactive tooltips showing detailed traffic information at specific points\n   - Yellow highlight indicators for selected data points\n\n4. Smooth transitions between different time ranges with animated scaling\n\nThese improvements allow users to better monitor and analyze network\ntraffic patterns over time, which is especially useful for debugging\nconnectivity issues or understanding network behavior under different\nconditions.\n\nThe implementation includes proper thread-safety considerations and\nhandles edge cases like time jumps or missing data appropriately.\n",

However, a CI failure may still\nhappen due to a number of reasons, for example:\n\n* Possibly due to a silent merge conflict (the changes in this pull request being\nincompatible with the current code in the target branch). If so, make sure to rebase on the latest\ncommit of the target branch.\n\n* A sanitizer issue, which can only be found by compiling with the sanitizer and running the\n  affected test.\n\n* An intermittent issue.\n\nLeave a comment here, if you need help tracking down a confusing failure.\n\n</details>\n",
