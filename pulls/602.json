I really do like simplicity of not keeping unused values across restarts. If I set a temporary ssh proxy value one day while I'm using bad wifi, I don't want that value sticking forever after I disabled the proxy, and confusing me months later or making it more difficult to set up tor. But #596 discusses this issue, #603 is one possible solution, and others solutions should be possible too. ",

For example, prune=2 -> prune=3 GB.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin.conf` does also now change the GUI, with `settings.json` taking precedence.  `bitcoin.conf` is never written to by the GUI or `settings.json`, as discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936#issuecomment-1013142512).\r\n\r\nAlso, main settings dialog has changed appropriately: \"Options set in this dialog are overridden by the command line\".  (It used to say ...\"or also in the configuration file\").  (It is not overridden by the config file, since it should be matching the config file).\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed:\r\n\r\nIf `settings.json` is empty, and `bitcoin.conf` is filled with settings; I open bitcoin-qt and the settings are reflected there.  I disable and re-enable those settings, close and open bitcoin-qt, shouldn't those settings be written in `settings.json`? They are not.\r\n",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/602#issuecomment-1133545038\r\n\r\n> One thing I noticed is, setting `prune=x,000` always results in x+1,000. For example, prune=2 -> prune=3 GB.\r\n\r\nThis can happen because `-prune` setting is specified in MiB (2^20 bytes) while GUI setting is specified in GB (10^9 bytes). So in various cases rounded values will be displayed. Like if you have `prune=600` in bitcoin.conf, the gui will display pruning size of 1GB. But as soon as you change settings in the GUI, it will add `\"prune\": 953` (1GB) or `1907` (2GB) or `2861` (3GB), etc to the `settings.json` file and whatever value is in `bitcoin.conf` will be ignored. If you edit the `settings.json` file manually, whatever value you specify will be used, but the GUI options dialog will convert it to GB for display. You should let me know if you see anything more strange than this, but hopefully behavior should be sensible in every case.\r\n\r\n> If `settings.json` is empty, and `bitcoin.conf` is filled with settings; I open bitcoin-qt and the settings are reflected there. I disable and re-enable those settings, close and open bitcoin-qt, shouldn't those settings be written in `settings.json`? They are not.\r\n\r\nThis is intentional. Only settings that a user actually changes will be written to `settings.json`. If all settings were copied to `settings.json`, then `bitcoin.conf` would stop having any effect after `settings.json` was written. Intention is for `bitcoin.conf` to be a source of settings from a packager or sysadmin, and `settings.json` to contain customizations from the user. User settings have precedence, but system settings take effect otherwise.",

AFAIK, this should only affect 22.x releases not 22.x and earlier releases because those releases were not reading the `settings.json` file. Also the intention is not to write all int settings as strings, only 3 specific int settings because of specific calls:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\naddOverriddenOption(\"-dbcache\");\r\naddOverriddenOption(\"-par\");\r\naddOverriddenOption(\"-prune\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/22.x/src/qt/optionsmodel.cpp#L40\r\n\r\nAlso since 22.x seems to be an active branch I backported the fix to it in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25180 in case there is another release. Probably need to keep this workaround anyway, but it might make it easier to get rid of in the future",

      "body": "> Could `_()` be avoided in the GUI code?\r\n> \r\n> See #454.\r\n\r\nI'm looking at approach taken in #454, but it doesn't seem to deal with template strings that have parameters. If I need to generalize that approach and use `QObject::tr()` method to format `\"Settings file %1 might be corrupt\"` template for the GUI, and `strprintf` to format `Settings file %s might be corrupt\" template for `debug.log`, that will be make the code more repetitive and make the translated/original code paths diverge more.\r\n\r\nI wonder why `_()` should be avoided in GUI code if handles bilingual strings well and we want bilingual strings for an init error? Is there a technical reason why `_()` does not work? Would be be difficult to fix?",
