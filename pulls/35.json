It changes gui code to go back to using gArgs and Params() functions directly instead of using interfaces::Node to handle arguments.\r\n\r\nThese changes were originally pushed as part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461. Motivation is to support a new GUI process connecting to an already running node process. Details are explained in commit messages, but in addition to spawning a new bitcoin-node process, we want bitcoin-gui to connect to an existing bitcoin-node process. So for that reason it should be able to parse its own parameters, rather than rely on the node.",

So for that reason it should be able to parse its own parameters, rather than rely on the node.\"",

Used your title and description.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: hebasto https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/35#issuecomment-660112406\r\n\r\n> I'll try to describe the desired behavior as I understand it. [...]\r\n\r\nYes that's a good description of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461.\r\n\r\n> How the possible conflicts between different process parsed arguments should be resolved?\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't actually change how arguments are interpreted, it just allows them to be sent differently in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461. Like you described above, in that PR if the gui process spawns a new node process, it forwards the arguments and there are no conflicts. But as mentioned in the PR description for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461 \"there are rough edges\" in that PR and \"if node command line options are passed to bitcoin-gui and bitcoin-gui connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored.\" More ideally, passing mismatched node options to bitcoin-gui would trigger errors or warnings. Adding this error checking could be a new commit in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461 or a followup PR.",

Therefore, their node() getters shouldn't include assert(m_node).\r\n\r\nI don't think this follows. It's ok for functions to have preconditions, and this is a pretty straightforward precondition to have for an accessor returning a reference.\r\n\r\n> I think the responsibility to check the pointer should be moved to callers.\r\n\r\nWe might just have a style disagreement here, but if there are specific changes you are looking for, maybe you could post them or describe them in more detail. I don't think we need to have pointers and null checks in places where the pointers can never be null. There's only one place in the PR that actually needs to check for a null node: the splash screen code handling the Q keypress needs to check if the node is connected before sending it a shutdown request. Everywhere else, references and not pointers are more appropriate and have been retained.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/35#pullrequestreview-451120856\r\n\r\n> I think the `m_shutdown` member should be dropped due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\nm_shutdown is needed so the splash screen can be shown instantly without waiting for anything and the Q key can function requesting a shutdown as soon as possible. Maybe this change could be moved to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461, but you could also say the same about all other changes in this PR. I hope the cleanups in this PR make sense by themselves, but the actual motivation for this PR is to enable https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461.\r\n\r\n> the m_shutdown member could require be protected by a mutex\r\n\r\nA mutex would only be required if Qt signals are used incorrectly.

I think we both agree handling a null pointer in the splashscreen is not strictly needed here. It's needed to handle the delayed gui->node connection implemented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461. The point of all the changes in this PR is to reduce size and complexity of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461. I think it makes sense to handle null node pointer in the splash screen here in this PR which is first introducing the pointer variable, even though the variable won't have a null value until https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461.",
