    "body": "Currently the network graph slider has 288 possible positions, and most of these are likely never used, due to obscure durations.\r\n\r\nThis pull request simplifies the slider to have only 12 positions, making it much easier to use, and setting the durations to more likely-wanted settings: 1m, 2m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h.\r\n\r\nThis change also allows easier rearranging of the window, for example, adding an extra button next to the reset button, shrinking the slider, and therefore making it still easy to use when smaller in length.",

I propose 1-10 in steps of 1, 10-60 in steps of 5, 1hr to 2hr in steps of 0.5hrs, 2hr to 6hr in steps of 1hr, 6hrs to 24hrs in steps of 3hrs.
