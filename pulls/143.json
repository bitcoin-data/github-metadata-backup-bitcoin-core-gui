      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,59 @@\n+# Icon policy\n+This document provides guidelines for contributing icons to Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Preparing Icons\n+Both an icon source file, in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format, and an optimised production file, in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, are required for \n+each icon.\n+\n+SVGs are used as source files due to being able to scale to any size whilst retaining image quality, but are not used in production due to limited support by \n+applications. If different sized production (PNG) icons are required they can be generated from the associated scaled SVG source file in a vector based tool like \n+Inkspace, Adobe illustrator, Figma, Sketch or Adobe XD.\n+\n+PNGs are used in production due to their wide support in applications, support of transparent backgrounds and better image quality than competing file types \n+such as JPEG.\n+\n+\n+### Icon Grid\n+Bitcoin Core uses an 8-point grid system for its icons which utilises size increments of 8px to visually orientate elements within a grid. Majority of screen sizes are divisible by 8 which makes fitting elements easier using an 8-point grid system. This makes things more efficient for designers and maintains consistency across applications. \n+\n+\n+### Icon Style\n+Icon style should follow a few basic principles to maintain consistency and clarity:\n+\n+- Icons should be minimal with little to no fine details. This is to make sure icons look good at any scale.  \n+- Icons size should be 32x32px. Different sized icons sizes may be necessary in some circumstances. If 32x32px is too small for the required icon placement, then the icon should be scaled up or down whilst sticking to the 8-point grid system.\n+- Shapes should be consistent and avoid organic elements that do not scale well.\n+- Colors should be consistent with other icons used in Bitcoin Core. \n+- Icons should should follow an 8-point grid system (see above). \n+\n+\n+### Optimizing Production Files (PNG): \n+Production (PNG) files are to be optmized before being added to Bitcoin Core. Optimizing PNG files removes various color profiles, ancillary (alla) and text chunks resulting in a reduction in size of the image file losslessly (without a lowered image quality). Any `zopflipng` / `pngcrush` based PNG optimizers can be used, below are some examples:\n+\n+- Open source tool [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/api).\n+- Open source tool [Trimage](https://trimage.org/).\n+- (Advanced) Run them through Bitcoin Cores [optimize-png.py](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/master/optimise-pngs.py) script.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Contributing\n+Icons should only be added to the Bitcoin Core repo via a pull request (PR) in two situations:\n+\n+- An icon used in production is being replaced with a new icon.\n+- A feature is being added to the Bitcoin Core GUI that requires the addition of a new icon.\n+\n+If a new icon is designed for an upcoming or active PR, the designer of the icon should [open an issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/new/choose) to get feedback on the design and to make sure it is consistent with Bitcoin Core's iconography.\n+\n+If a new feature is being added to the Bitcoin Core GUI that requires a new icon the developer should [open an issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/new/choose) requesting an icon to be designed. \n+\n+Icons (both SVG and PNG) should not be added to the Bitcoin Core repo if they are not yet used in production.\n+\n+When opening a PR that adds an icon source (SVG) files should be added to `src/qt/res/src` at 32x32px and optimized production (PNG) files should be added to `src/qt/res/icons` at 32x32px.
