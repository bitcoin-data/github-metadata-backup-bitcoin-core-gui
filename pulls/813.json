    "body": "Fixes: #809\r\n\r\nPreviously it was possible through the GUI to enter an IP address:port into the \"Proxy IP\" configuration box. After the node was restarted the errant setting would prevent the node starting back up until manually removed from settings.json.\r\n\r\nPrevent this with a simple check for \":\" in the string. This is acceptable here in the GUI setting because we already fail on a hostname such as \"http://x.x.x.x\", so it won't cause false positives.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

In contrast this fix prevents a bug whereby an incorrect setting can stop the node starting up.\r\n\r\nThe only potential issue I saw with my own solution was that it would outright prevent setting the tor proxy IP to an IPv6 address, however from my (quick) research, it didn't seem that this was actually something anyone did (and it might not even be possible/practical to do). If I'm wrong on this, I'll be happy to update the solution further, but from what I can see even setting Tor ORPort to IPV6 is barely supported, and ControlPort is limited to an IPv4 address:port...",

      "body": "> I'm not convinced that a large regex is \"simpler\" than checking if a \":\" is in the string?\r\n\r\nThe large one was for the port number, the one I referred as \"simpler\" was for the IP address: `QRegularExpression ipRegex(\"^([0-9]{1,3}\\\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$\");`. What I meant is that we know in advance that the \":\" would be invalid so we could restrict the user to even enter it. As current we could see this (not only \":\"):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/110166421/139224e2-aa0d-444b-9ff9-ad75f4763c7c)\r\n\r\nThe regex would keep it cleaner, more user friendly and we don't have to do an extra validation, but I'll stop trying to convince you :smile: (btw, also we'd need to set the max length to 15/ follow up).\r\n\r\n> I don't feel that interested in picking them here with the QML work going on, and them not being much of an issue IMO. \r\n\r\nQML is far for being at the stage where QT currently is, improving user experience could also be useful for both projects feedback.\r\n\r\n> In contrast this fix prevents a bug whereby an incorrect setting can stop the node starting up.\r\n\r\nI agree and there's a [workaround](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/809#issuecomment-2026525827) already which is just removing the IP line from the file.\r\n\r\n> The only potential issue I saw with my own solution was that it would outright prevent setting the tor proxy IP to an IPv6 address, however from my (quick) research, it didn't seem that this was actually something anyone did (and it might not even be possible/practical to do). If I'm wrong on this, I'll be happy to update the solution further, but from what I can see even setting Tor ORPort to IPV6 is barely supported, and ControlPort is limited to an IPv4 address:port...\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to enable those checkboxes?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/assets/110166421/762d4653-3d8b-402e-86e0-4b78257ab5fb)\r\n",
