    "body": "This combines #492, #483, #484, and #473 and also fixes #532 by adding the ability to change between graph durations without losing the data (it's sampled at each interval). Also added is some graphical animations when the X or Y scale changes. (it might be necessary to make this optional on lower performing hardware, such as the raspberry pi).\r\n\r\nOne more feature is that the graph will start on the smallest duration, and automatically increase the graph duration once the graph is filled.\r\n\r\nSome examples can be seen in my comment at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/539#issuecomment-1031852315 \r\n\r\nI'm expecting there may be issues with my coding style, so I'll create this PR as a draft at this stage.",
